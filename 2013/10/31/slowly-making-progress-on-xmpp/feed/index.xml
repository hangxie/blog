					<description><![CDATA[Data fragmentation is still not done yet, but I&#039;ve integrated ejabberd&#039;s authentication with Web site (session for now, token later), also pubsub works as expected, a quick test shows that publishing to a node with 10K subscribers takes ~6 seconds. If everything is linear then this would be a good (acceptable) number since sending to 100M users will take about 17 hours. Our use case shows that the biggest subscription is ~100K.

I haven&#039;t play with more with information publishing yet, will focus on data fragmentation first.]]></description>
