					<description><![CDATA[Finally I flash my HTC Inspire 4G to Jelly Bean so that I can run it as HotSpot.

It took me quite some time to figure out that flash the phone actually need to fastboot boot - I tried all sort of ROM but still cannot get my phone back until I read a post (cannot recall exact address) telling that you need to flash boot.img ...

It could be common sense to those who does flash for all the time, but for people like me who just do it once or twice, it do need some good step-by-step guide. Note that lots of ROMs do have a installation guide, but obviously I&#039;m not the target user.]]></description>
