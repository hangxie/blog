					<description><![CDATA[Cannot recall all the details, but I&#039;m pretty sure the multi-cores machines didn&#039;t give me exciting results.

Anyway, being away from Cassandra for quite something, it should have some improvement I believe, so you are on your own to do some more tests. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hello, how about the multicore experiment&#039;s result?
I have done similar experiments in single multicore node.
I found the maximum concurrency is 3 for cassandra, and i don&#039;t know why. If you are interested, can you contact me through email?]]></description>
