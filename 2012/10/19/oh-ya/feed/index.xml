					<description><![CDATA[Dovecot support &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki2.dovecot.org/PostLoginScripting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;post-login script&lt;/a&gt; so tracking user&#039;s last login time is easy. However, I went to 1.x document site at the very beginning so it took me quite some time to figure out the configuration problem.

Also, don&#039;t forget exec &quot;$@&quot; ... which could be the place that most mistakes come from.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[XMPP messages are now archived to mysql ... not that pretty but it works, thanks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndl.kiev.ua/content/mod_archive_odbc-release&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mod_archive_odbc&lt;/a&gt;, however, I still cannot make use of MySQL native server, so it is still based on libmyodbc.

Information for this part is really limited, and erlang is not something that everyone can read and write, I will post some more details later on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Updates: I went back to maildrop as people are saying procmail is not that actively maintained and could fade away in the future.

Status: now all incoming non-spam mails are copied to corresponding gmail accounts (don&#039;t want to use single one which may mess things up), and all spams went to spam folder (for IMAP/webmail).

To-do: mail alert to XMPP client (how to avoid alert bombs?), XMPP message backup (should to go the same gmail account), and outgoing email backup.

Stay tuned.]]></description>
