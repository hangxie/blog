					<description><![CDATA[Keep posting - I just enabled nagios check for php5-fpm service.

First you need to enable status page for php5-fpm by uncommenting this in configuration:
pm.status_path = /status

Then grab &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adoy/PHP-FastCGI-Client&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fastcgi client library for php&lt;/a&gt;, then just several lines of code:

&lt;pre&gt;$host = &#039;localhost&#039;;
$port = 9000;
$options = getopt(&#039;H:p:&#039;);
if (isset($options[&#039;H&#039;]) &amp;&amp; !empty($options[&#039;H&#039;])) {
    $host = $options[&#039;H&#039;];
}
if (isset($options[&#039;p&#039;]) &amp;&amp; !empty($options[&#039;p&#039;])) {
    $port = $options[&#039;p&#039;];
}

$client = new FCGIClient($host, $port);
$response = $client-&gt;request(
                array(
                    &#039;REQUEST_METHOD&#039; =&gt; &#039;GET&#039;,
                    &#039;SCRIPT_FILENAME&#039; =&gt; &#039;/status&#039;,
                    &#039;SCRIPT_NAME&#039; =&gt; &#039;/status&#039;,
                    &#039;QUERY_STRING&#039; =&gt; &#039;&#039;
                    ),
                    &#039;&#039;
                );
echo str_replace(array(&quot;\r&quot;, &quot;\n&quot;), &quot; &quot;, $response);&lt;/pre&gt;

and things are done. Sure you need to go through all configuration changes for nagios, nrpe, and grapher if you want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here comes more about nagiosgrapher setup.

After installation on Ubuntu, it seems several commonly used services were not added to default graph generation, include:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mysql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

For load and user, it&#039;s pretty simple - copy corresponding check_*.ncfg files from /usr/share/nagiosgrapher/debian/cfg/ngraph.d/standard to /etc/nagiosgrapher/ngraph.d/standard, restart nagiosgrapher service, wait for all machines had done at least one check for both services (so that server&#039;s configuration under /etc/nagios3/conf.d/ngraph/serviceext got updated), then restart nagios3 service to make them show up in the web interface.

mysql is a tricky thing, it seems check_mysql.ncfg has some problems so you need to tweak it (after copy to /etc/nagiosgrapher/ngraph.d/standard), include:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the first two sections as there is no such a thing in the stats talking about &quot;diff&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rename all &#039;mysql-info&#039; to mysql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change Flushtables: to Flush tables: so it matches what exactly in the mysql status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change Opentables: to Open tables:, same reason as above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(I guess this is optional) change queries: to Slow queries:, and avg: to Queries per second avg:, I believe this is optional because the existing regular expression is runnable, though my changes make it easy to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Then just do what I mentioned above for check_load and check_users, it should be there.

Again there are something new in recent nagios - it can extract data from log (or status message) with graph_log_regex directive, while in the old days one can only read data from performance data parts. Sure you can still read data from value part with graph_perf_regex.]]></description>
