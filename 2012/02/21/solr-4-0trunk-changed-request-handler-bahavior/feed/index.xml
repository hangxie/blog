					<description><![CDATA[Late but at least I got it done - I&#039;ve done my first version of patch on TermVectorComponent.java, and it works (well, at least to me) in distributed environment, what I need to do next are: test in distributed and non-distributed environment, with single result, multiple results, etc., to make sure it is a good patch, and then I need to make decision of how the result will be presented especially whenever there are multiple documents returned from the search, and at last submit the patch to solr, to see if it will be accepted or not.

However, I will post the patch here despite of it will be accepted by solr community or not, at least it will help some others who want this.]]></description>
