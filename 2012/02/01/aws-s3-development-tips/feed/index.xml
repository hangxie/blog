					<description><![CDATA[Hi Hang!
Thanks for the response.

It is right, and I was doing it the right way also. The problem was in Amazon permissions. But the strange warning keeps showing. Maybe its a version incompatibility bug, or a pre-compiler error, don&#039;t know. The important think is that its working now :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you sure you got the right line for the error? I feel like that you were trying to use &quot;metadata&quot; to make a call and that causes the problem.

And I have almost exacxtly the same code as you do (for this line) without any problem, and I pasted here in case you want to do a double check:

        S3GetObjectMetadataRequest * getObjectMetadataRequest = [[S3GetObjectMetadataRequest alloc] initWithKey:objectName withBucket:bucketName];

Or maybe you want to post some more code plus errors so that we can look into.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi. I found your blog post when searching for a solution for my problem. Your post help me in finding the right direction but I&#039;m still stuck trying to get the etag of the file without having to download it first.
Using the S3GetObjectMetadataRequest seems to be the right way, buuut, trying to initialize the object gives me a serious warning, and later after getting the metadata response the object is empty.
The initializing is this: 
S3GetObjectMetadataRequest *metadata = [[S3GetObjectMetadataRequest alloc] initWithKey:key withBucket:bucket];

and the warning is:
Incompatible Objective-C types initializing &#039;struct S3GetObjectRequest *&#039;, expected &#039;struct S3GetObjectMetadataRequest *&#039;

using cast doesn&#039;t fix it.

I would be very glad to you if you could help me finding a solution.
Thanks you advance and congrats for your blog.]]></description>
