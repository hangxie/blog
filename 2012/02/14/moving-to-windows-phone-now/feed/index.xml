					<description><![CDATA[Done with main screen - it seems the UIViewController cannot get rotation enabled by Interface Builder, you have to subclass it.

And now I found actually I have another thing left - localization, will spend another day on that :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, it seems not that hard and I&#039;ve made it, mostly. All UIViewController subclasses now have these lines:

&lt;pre language=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
{
    // Return YES for supported orientations
    return interfaceOrientation != UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

I just need to get the start screen done which does not reflect to any customized subclasses ...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[BTW, I forgot to mention (or I did before?) that I&#039;ve upgraded my VM on Mac from Windows XP to Windows 7 so that I can run development tools. I believe people will jump up if Microsoft did this before, but after Apple made it as a common case (they need latest OSX to run latest development tools, may not be exactly the latest, but similar), people no longer yelling at this.

Poor Microsoft.]]></description>
