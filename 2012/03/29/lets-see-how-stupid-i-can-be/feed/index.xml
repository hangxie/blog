					<description><![CDATA[BTW, I had no problem sending massive mails from my Yahoo account to Kindle, but Google blocked me after sending ~200 documents in about 15 mails. I don&#039;t want to blame the policy as I hate abusers more than Yahoo and Google, but I would appreciate Google if it can be as smart as Yahoo, as it can easily determine what I&#039;m doing.

Or maybe Yahoo trusts me just because I&#039;ve been with Yahoo for too long? If this is the case, I have nothing to blame Google but I&#039;m going to use Yahoo more for sure.

Either way Google is a loser, hehe.]]></description>
