					<description><![CDATA[Just counted again - I&#039;m managing mail system for 8 domains, though 2 of them will be retired this month. All those 8 mail systems were running on 3 separated servers, and I&#039;ve migrated 5 to Google mail include the one I finished yesterday. Other than those 2 to be retired, there is only one mail system to be migrated, but depend on my friend&#039;s decision.

Anti-spam and anti-virus is really memory-bounded application, BTW.]]></description>
