					<description><![CDATA[Alright, I got two articles that have same conclusion as I got:

http://www.workswithu.com/2009/04/27/kvm-vs-vmware-a-case-study/

http://www.linux-kvm.com/content/kvm-vs-vmware-esx-which-can-run-more-virtual-machines

roughly, on same hardware, number of VMs that they can support is 5 (KVM) vs. 3 (VMWare), which is close to mine (4 vs. 2).

It seems the reason is KVM (which proxmox is using) is doing much more better than VMWare.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Obviously Proxmox is doing much better than VMWare ESX, though I don&#039;t know where the difference comes from.

I created 4 VMs under proxmox, each with 1 CPU, 512M mem, and 10G disk, then I launched Cassandra on all these four, and started my load generation client (simple write), average response time is about 8ms/write (tested with 100K writes), but the number I got from VMWare ESX with 2 VMs was ... 25ms/write, and with 4 VMs it was ~50ms.

I think VMWare ESX is doing something seriously wrong, or both are using totally different technology that it does not make sense to compare them at all. Anyway, I will stick with proxmox which has much better performance and, no more license issues.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I need to do another test to prove what I mentioned above is correct - it seems VM matters, at least ProxMox is doing better than VMWare ESX, but this is just feeling for now, I will get clear picture after I get the test done.

BTW, the test will be my first Python program on Linux :P]]></description>
