					<description><![CDATA[Alright, someone did a great comparison for me :D

http://www.rackspacecloud.com/blog/2009/11/09/nosql-ecosystem/

Obviously I made same conclusion as he did, at least Cassandra scored the highest.

People commented to the blog mentioning MongoDB becomes distributed now, I don&#039;t think I have time testing though ... but once I have time I will test MongoDB instead of CouchDB.

Again tough decision to choose where to go, I will settle done Cassandra first.]]></description>
