					<description><![CDATA[Here are more detailed items after thinking about the plan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. Python for web (the statistic project with nosql solution), get one framework for RAD (a shopping site without cart feature)
2. C/C++ for Python extension (turn performance bottleneck of the statistic project into C/C++ module)
3. Delphi for Windows, fail back to Visual C++ (the PPCam project)
4. Java for desktop (some random samples, don&#039;t need to be a serious project)
5. Ada/Lisp as a hobby (server side development, no project current in mind)
6. Public cloud service and private cloud operation
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I found that I didn&#039;t mention nosql, big mistake, but I will hook it up with Python for Web, and I will still follow Cassandra, but also spend some time on CouchDB and MongoDB, if there is no other projects become interesting.]]></description>
