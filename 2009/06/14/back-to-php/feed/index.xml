					<description><![CDATA[Hang&#039;s right, Avoid Godaddy for you django needs. 

They just recently started to offer ssh access so I attempted to get django running by installing flup and django locally in my home directory (using --prefix flag on the setup.py). It worked great and hooked up with FastCGI and displayed the &quot;It Worked/Welcome to Django&quot; page but trying to build something you obviously need a database and when i selected mysql and sqlite it would crash because both modules aren&#039;t installed on godaddy&#039;s linux shared hosting machines. All attempts to have their techs type &quot;yum install python-sqlite2&quot; have been met with &quot;please upgrade to a VPS&quot; from their representatives. How can they put on their site that they support python when it&#039;s missing all modules/api&#039;s to access databases?! USELESS!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Python is in godaddy&#039;s first class supporting list, thinking of it&#039;s running 2.4 now (guess they need that for yum), I don&#039;t think you can have a useable python environment there.

I&#039;m sticking on symfony now, not that bad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m actually close to getting django setup on godaddy shared hosting. Its up and running but my only problem is that the python bindings for sqlite/mysql aren&#039;t installed so there is no way for django to communicate with a database. Pretty pointless, I&#039;ll post how i got it to display the test page if i ever get their tech support to yum install python-sqlite2]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Performance wise of view, CakePHP sucks, but people also mentioned Symfony is using other PHP components (such for its ORM etc), so it could cause some more issues as TurboGears (this is why lots of people chose Django).

I&#039;m doing some tests now to see which one fits me more, I care both development time and production performance ... I know, I&#039;m picky.]]></description>
