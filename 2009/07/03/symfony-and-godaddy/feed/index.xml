					<description><![CDATA[Since you require composer installed on a server to install Symfony and other PHP frameworks, I don&#039;t think you can do that on shared servers. Because you don&#039;t get composer there. I wouldn&#039;t recommend shared server anyway because of lack of security and performance issues. A better option is some affordable dedicated server like DigitalOcean, unless you know how to set it up. If you don&#039;t have sysadmin experience for that, then you can use Cloudways &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudways.com/en/php-cloud-hosting.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PHP MySQL hosting&lt;/a&gt; platform where the server is configured automatically and you get managed digitalocean server. You also get composer pre-installed, so you can install any php framework or CMS you want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks! this post was very helpful, but besides changing factories.yml, I also had to change file extensions on GoDaddy, so .php used PHP 5.x instead of PHP 5.x FastCGI. 

I got that hint from the following link:
http://cegeekbook.blogspot.com/2010/07/php-no-input-file-specified-godaddy.html

Hope it helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi!

Thanks a lot for your tips! It all worked for me except for one thing.. I can access my site through the dev interface (both frontend_dev.php and backend_dev.php). But I can&#039;t access it via the production environment... It just keeps returning me a non-symfony &quot;404 page not found&quot; page... I guess it must have to be something in .htaccess.. A

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, and thanks for the help. Actually putting the second fix in seems to be causing the relinking error, and that error goes away when I remove LD_PRELOAD from .bash_profile. However, in both cases, I get this error - 

&quot;You must launch symfony command line with the symfony script&quot;

I did a bit of digging, and this is the first fail case message in symfony.php, supposed to be displayed when $sf_lib_dir is not set.

Part two of my deployment headache is that the empty action/module error refuses to go away, even with the REQUEST_URI solution. However, when I check Symfony settings on the error page, I notice that the sf_lib_dir is correctly set.

Any help would be welcome. Thanks]]></description>
