Difficult site navigation: While reviewing your site, we found that it
was down. Google ads may not be published on a site that is not fully
launched, functioning, or easily navigable. Once your site is
functioning and has enough content for our specialists to review, we
will be happy to reconsider your application. If there is a typo in the
URL submitted, you can resubmit your application with the correct site
by following the directions below.
&lt;/q&gt;
