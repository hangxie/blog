					<description><![CDATA[Hey, thanks for the offer, but seriously, I&#039;m looking for another internet service provider now. Why? Here is the story:

Dec 29 I chat with Comcast presentative online asking if I can get something close to the $69.99 promotion (I was paying $116, tax included a month for both Internet and cable), I was told it is impossible to get any cable deal better than what I had (more than $60 a month).

Dec 30 I called DirectTV struck a deal

Dec 31 DirectTV installed everything

Dec 31 I chat with another Comcast representative again to cancel my cable, and asked if I can get a better deal for Internet, I was given $29.99, which seems not bad. However, I have to call Comcast&#039;s 1800 number to cancel my cable service to make sure my service won&#039;t be interrupt, fair enough.

Jan 1~3 holiday

Jan 4 I called the 1800 number, and was told $29.99 Internet is promotion price for a bundle, which means I cannot get it as I canceled my cable, so I still need to pay nearly $50 for my Internet service.

My current solution is that I have to stick with Comcast as I don&#039;t have any backup plan yet, but as I mentioned, I will shop around to see if I can get anything even a penny cheaper.

Right, I&#039;m not happy with what happened to me.]]></description>
