It&#8217;s not cheap to maintain a mail server now thinking of all resources put on it, I was managing mail system for 6 domains running on 3 different servers, I can see those servers were spending more and more memory and CPU cycles on anti-spam and anti-virus, and some other applications are unable to run &#8211; like my friend&#8217;s shopping site. Google is helping, with no cost you can have acceptable anti-spam feature, much better SLA (compare with those personal servers, not the big sites like Yahoo \ud83d\ude00 ), and pretty good access speed (again, compare with personal setup).<\/p>\n<p>The second thing is mobile, have to say, Google is good at delivering products with clean UI. I was using Yahoo Go for quite some time, but never understand: 1, why does it contain so many features include fancy stuff like widget? 2, why does it still do http for all the time (feel like that)? Mobile devices are not that powerful, while people want speed, speed, and speed. So, moving web pages to mobile device is not the right solution to create a mobile application, I want native and light application (even wml is better).<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s not fun to see Google is doing better on mail thinking of I&#8217;m still a big Yahoo mail fan, just wish mobile team can get some better products.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just migrated one more mail system to Google mail, why?
