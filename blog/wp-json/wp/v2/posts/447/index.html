We jumped in to help verifying the system, and obviously there are way too many issues. I believe we found 30 or so potential problems with the system, and they point to 10 (I guess) real bugs in codes.<\/p>\n<p>Other than this I also prepared data for a QA environment, which &#8230; took me 7 hours babysitting it, I&#8217;m proud of doing good estimation job &#8211; it was planned for 6 hours and people tried to bargain it to 4, and sure I denied and proved I did the right thing \ud83d\ude00<\/p>\n<p>There is a production launch today and some planning works as well last week, not that much headache, but just need time spending in all those planning meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Another QA team is troublesome &#8211; they used to give me some test data and asked me to verify them in our QA environment, but from time to time it turned out they gave me the wrong data, or their system did work, which means those data never hit our system. I was really careful not to make assumption too early, but &#8230; finally I shout at them, saying &#8220;stop assuming our components are having problem&#8221; cos I don&#8217;t want to waste my time any more. Funny thing is that after 3 rounds like this, they still unable to find a reasonable set of test cases so I don&#8217;t know how they are going to proceed with their testing, hehe.<\/p>\n<p>There will be a new international data center opening in near future, they are asking for data verification as it is a brand new one. I should have a tool to generate stats they want, but I never spent time on it. It&#8217;s stupid to spend one hour everytime they want the stats, but I just didn&#8217;t have 4 hours to finish the tool. I guess I will never compose one as we are transferring things out.<\/p>\n<p>There is no news for the new project, there are somebody working on design stuffs, and I guess I will be coder later on, I like it anyway &#8211; easy life.<\/p>\n<p>There will be a new release (bug fix) for the system we are verifying, and once it hits the QA environment we will do another round full verification, best thing to kill time \ud83d\ude42 .<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was a super busy week &#8211; actually it was almost same busy as all weeks in year 2008, but after the organization change happened last December, it could be the busiest week I ever had.
