I used to learn something new just for fun, but later on this &#8220;something&#8221; helped me a lot on some serious projects.<\/p>\n<p>The most recent sample is Cassandra, I started playing with it since last Sep or Oct, it was just because I heard of this &#8220;NoSQL&#8221; idea and it was trying to solve the problem I&#8217;ve been working on for so long (BTW, I used to use LDAP). Then among all those NoSQL solutions, in couple of weeks I locked myself on Cassandra.<\/p>\n<p>Then my team switched from old project to the new one (start from Nov last year), and I got involved starting from this Jan (was doing transition prior to that). I heard about lot of different description about the project, but have no idea until Feb (yes, a month after I join the new project). Then, I found that knowledge I learn from Cassandra helped me really a lot, things like consistent hashing, dynamic deployment (adding\/removing nodes, etc), and things like Avro (I don&#8217;t know how much Cassandra is using it, but it was the first time I heard of it).<\/p>\n<p>Actually there was another team was trying to use Cassandra for their new project, but executive (I&#8217;m not sure which level, maybe SVP or EVP) forced them moved to in-house solution, which is what we are working on, I don&#8217;t the story behind that, but you can definitely get the idea of how similar these two are.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I think it&#8217;s time to try something new as I need to prepare for my next project, it used to take 6 months or so.<\/p>\n<p>P.S. previous samples (for all those I can share with public):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I started playing with HTTP\/Socket, 8 months later I got a job from a web company. I was trying to let multiple clients using single mainframe connection (the whole office of ~15 people got only one connection as it was expensive and difficult to setup), it became a bridge based on TCP (TCP was still fancy at that time in my industry), then found that I can actually use it to serve queries over the web so I setup a Web server for that (over IIS I remember), etc.<\/li>\n<li>I started playing with Linux on my home machine, about 9 months later company officially announce that we are moving to RHEL. In the first 3 months of migration, I got huge number of pings from developers (FreeBSD experts) from different team over the IM, asking me this or that kind of question, and the most popular question is &#8220;how can I find out if this package got installed on my box?&#8221; and the answer is &#8220;rpm -qa | grep -i package-name&#8221; :-W &#8230;<\/li>\n<li>I started playing with MySQL (actually for a friend&#8217;s web site), 5 months later I became a heavy MySQL user\/admin (I beat Oracle guys at that time, yeah)<\/li>\n<li>I started playing Windows SDK to do some desktop development, 3 months later one of my friends asked me to build a music player &#8211; that was a crazy project, I finished the first version in Delphi, my friend told me she can only find C++ developers, so I deliver a C++ Builder version, then she mentioned actually those developers know VC++ only (so there are lots of &#8220;C++&#8221; under Windows &gt;:) ), so the final version was actually VC++ Express<\/li>\n<li>and other 2~3 cases that I don&#8217;t think I can share as there are some internal terms which could be corporate trade secret &#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sure there are some other negative cases, the most significant is Ada &#8211; I spent quite some time on GNAT, etc, did pretty much development, but so far I&#8217;m not seeing any possibility to utilize it in any projects.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I think I have luck, or 6th sense, or whatever, on technical areas.
