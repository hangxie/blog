I can test fail-over etc later on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also composed some scripts to do service stuffs &#8211; the script I composed can start\/stop\/restart Cassandra gracefully, it can also tell status of the node and the cluster, it&#8217;s a simple Shell script, I will make it a service under Fedora, and a init.d script under Ubuntu (I&#8217;m running only these two platform now). Cassandra was upgrade from 0.4.1 to 0.4.2 days ago, and I used that as a chance to test my deployment stuffs, seems pretty good. I think I just need to be careful with 0.4.x =&gt; 0.5.x upgrade since it may break compatibility on configuration and command line.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve converted my PowerBook to a dedicated client machine running Fedora &#8230; it&#8217;s a pretty old machine and seems Apple does not want to roll out new software (such as JDK 1.6) for it, so I did some survey around and picked Fedora (Ubuntu is not ppc friendly &#8211; the support is community based).<\/p>\n<p>And finally I have Thrift\/PHP up and running. At the very beginning I was thinking I should use Java as the client but later one found that I have no idea how to develop Java based web application, and since Thrift mentioned it supports all C\/C++, Java, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Python pretty well, I should just pick my favorite language to do the test and then let real clients pick what they\u00a0 want to use (where is my client, BTW? \ud83d\ude41 ).<\/p>\n<p>And yes, I confirmed the schema (though Cassandra is schema-less thing), I&#8217;m going to test the schema with PHP client today. After that I will have to find a place to hold all my codes\/configuration, etc, in a subversion, and based on what I found so far, github.com is the best candidate.<\/p>\n<p>Will update here today or tomorrow.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve deployed Cassandra to my development environment, running on 4 servers with replica 2.
