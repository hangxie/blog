So I created a class member to hold the connection, and __init__ of every class instance, I &#8220;ping&#8221; the connection by describe_keyspace (assume it access meta data only which would be fast).

It seems I can only run with some kind lock mechanism to avoid this from happening, which is tough and frankly speaking, I don&#8217;t know how to make it efficient.<\/p>\n<p>So I changed wsgi configuration, make it one thread per process, by doing so I can be sure while I&#8217;m doing the &#8220;ping&#8221; there is only one request for this class (process), so I can safely do whatever I want, as within the class (process) there is no parallel execution.<\/p>\n<p>The performance is pretty good, I will tune to see how many processes I should run for the wsgi daemon, but with 5 processes, I can reach 190 ms average\/250 ms maximum for 10 concurrent clients, 380\/450 for 20 concurrent clients, and550\/650 for 30, pretty linear in term of average response time.<\/p>\n<p>It seems, to me at least, thread is not a great idea always, I cannot tell how much performance gain can it gives me, but it at least makes things complicated.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems by default wsgi use 15 threads per daemon process, it sounds like a cool feature at the very beginning, but later it turned to nightmare to me.
