For search and massive data storage in key-value pair format, I may give them out.<\/p>\n<p>Tough decision though, always need to convince my team members agree that we should focus on key features instead of doing everything all by ourselves. We are still a big company and share a common platform will give the whole company a good shape of look.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are several teams that want to provide technical solution for my team in various area, and I&#8217;m thinking of adopting them or rejecting.
