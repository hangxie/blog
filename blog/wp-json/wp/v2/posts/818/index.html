However, if things moving smoothly, I wish I can:<\/p>\n<p>Try to find something interesting to do as my job &#8230; no detail yet. I wish I can still be here with my current company, but just in case it becomes impossible, I may think about some different industry.<\/p>\n<p>Next comes to my mind is re-arrange development environment at home, whenever I said &#8220;re-arrange&#8221; I actually meant &#8230; more :D. In a ideal world (though the world can never be ideal) I will retire the P4 box, use a iMac replace it, and get a 8 cores machines as my dedicated testing environment which is currently running on a dual core desktop, and then I will upgrade the 4-core desktop to Windows 7, and retires the PowerBook and the Asus laptop (1.1G &#8230;) as well. In this way I will have only 5 machines at home, but with 8 more cores.<\/p>\n<p>If I can get a 8 core box, I will run 10~15 VMs on the machine, so that I can testing all sort of cluster ideas. Also, I&#8217;m going to use different distro (again), include CentOS\/Fedora, Debian\/Ubuntu.<\/p>\n<p>I wish I can get familiar with Python on web development, I should evaluate a framework though I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to use it anyway, but if there is any chance, I should build up a site with the framework, to make it my RAD solution for web development :). As for Python, I also need to try out doing extension with C\/C++, so that in case there is any performance bottleneck comes from Python I can get over it.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I will have interest do desktop development again, if I have it could be the time to try Delphi again, but I can imagine after couple of days excitement, I will move to Visual C++ because of Delphi&#8217;s buggy system (please, Delphi, please make yourself better, or just workable). I don&#8217;t have any specific project so far, but if I can at least re-write the P2P webcam thing. Java can also be an alternative for desktop development, I will definitely NOT use Java on Web as it is just horrible, but it may fit into desktop, who knows.<\/p>\n<p>Hobby study &#8211; get to try Ada and Lisp (yea, again). I will check to see if I can make Ada a server side programming language, and try to do some small client side applications. I don&#8217;t have confidence on working on these two, but whenever I have time, I will always do something.<\/p>\n<p>There are something purely for learning, as I don&#8217;t want to put money on trying them out &#8211; all those cloud services like Amazon S3, Ec2, Google App Engine, and maybe something from Microsoft, etc. I need to at least understand how these things are working (i.e. operation related stuffs), so that once I need them, I won&#8217;t run into blind. I may also try out Ubuntu&#8217;s private cloud (is this its name?) and see how it can fit into an enterprise environment.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to put any personal\/family\/friend plan here, it&#8217;s too hard to plan and also involves privacy issue :D, but roughly speaking, I wish I can spend more time with people around me, make them happy. I want to get some amount of money to pay off part of my mortgage, or get a new car, but I never had a good plan of how to getting money other than salary, so it could be just a wish.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2009 is a tough year to everybody, I just wish world becomes better in year 2010.
