Building a perfect achitecture is not that fast, even with PHP frontend and C\/C++ backend. Almost all this kind of applications are database oriented, with less complex logic but needs to be fancy in UI. Thinking of most frameworks work AJAX UI, this seems to be the best choice.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, once the application needs to be turned to a real web site, performance, capacity, and security, etc. will become critical, and at that time I would like to change the whole platform from a framework to a solid achitecture.
