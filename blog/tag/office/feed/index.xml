					<description><![CDATA[I cannot believe that people from the team across the hallway are still talking about Microsoft! I mean it&#8217;s reasonable to discuss about it while it was uncertain so I didn&#8217;t complain even a little 3 weeks back as they need to communicate to make sure they are getting the right deal from Microsoft.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I cannot believe that people from the team across the hallway are still talking about Microsoft!</p>
<p>I mean it&#8217;s reasonable to discuss about it while it was uncertain so I didn&#8217;t complain even a little 3 weeks back as they need to communicate to make sure they are getting the right deal from Microsoft. However, since they&#8217;ve decided sign/not sign, they should get themselves prepared for moving to Microsoft or staying here.</p>
<p>Anyway &#8211; I&#8217;m abnormal for almost all the cases related to career, so my feeling could be weird.</p>
