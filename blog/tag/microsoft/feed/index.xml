					<description><![CDATA[I cannot believe that people from the team across the hallway are still talking about Microsoft! I mean it&#8217;s reasonable to discuss about it while it was uncertain so I didn&#8217;t complain even a little 3 weeks back as they need to communicate to make sure they are getting the right deal from Microsoft.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I cannot believe that people from the team across the hallway are still talking about Microsoft!</p>
<p>I mean it&#8217;s reasonable to discuss about it while it was uncertain so I didn&#8217;t complain even a little 3 weeks back as they need to communicate to make sure they are getting the right deal from Microsoft. However, since they&#8217;ve decided sign/not sign, they should get themselves prepared for moving to Microsoft or staying here.</p>
<p>Anyway &#8211; I&#8217;m abnormal for almost all the cases related to career, so my feeling could be weird.</p>

<p> Anyway, this kind of upgrade is really bothering &#8211; why do they need original installation disc while upgrading/patching? Weird. </p>
<p> I&#8217;m still waiting here, seems it takes about 30 minutes to install it, and to make the environment clean, the orignal installation has to be removed followed by a reboot, so overall it takes about an hour. </p>
<p> Maybe it&#8217;s time to ask for a new and powerful laptop. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>

<p>Actually I believe Microsoft was wasting money &#8211; I register a domain a while back but never used it, at all.</p>
