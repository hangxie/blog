										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some guy showed me how to use GarageBand to create fancy music thing during a open house event of a piano school, it was pretty impressive and he told me the software is free from Mac, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Pity once I got home, after checking the PowerBook (but it&#8217;s running the latest Leopard), I found no GarageBand at all. It seems it&#8217;s part of iLife, which is not free &#8211; It could be free for new Mac buyers but obviously I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Then someone post a review on Apple&#8217;s new Snow Leopard, there are only two things I got from the article &#8211; 64-bit support, and office usage. I don&#8217;t think my old PowerBook qualifies to either of them, so most likely it will run current Leopard forever.</p>
