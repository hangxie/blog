										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I guess Solr guys will hate me as I posted 3 versions of patches to Jira, just because I didn&#8217;t (and I don&#8217;t) totally understand how Solr distributed search works.</p>
<p>However, I don&#8217;t care too much as I just want to leave some clues on the Web so that anyone who&#8217;s facing similar problem as I was (several weeks ago) can get some hints of how to solve the problem. I&#8217;m pretty sure everybody has his/her own idea of how to solve this issue since it is pretty particular to one&#8217;s domain, and my patch is a good start point.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to speak out the name but the one who originally composed distributed search for term vector is &#8230; irresponsible. I don&#8217;t know if he/she did any test or not, or if he/she understand Solr or not, but that piece of crap got committed to source, proved &#8220;more eyes, better quality&#8221; just a joke.</p>
