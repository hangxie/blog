										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems ipvsadm does not do health check, etc., so I turned to keepalived. While keepalived is doing great job on adding live node back and removing dead node out, it does not have a good way to dump current rules and stats, also it has problem during startup time.</p>
<p>I think latest keepalived may have solved the problem though I haven&#8217;t tried yet. If it works fine I will leave ipvsadm installed to be the utility tool only (i.e. disable service coming from ipvsadm).</p>
<p>I will look around to see if there is anything else similar to keepalived or not, it should be, I think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Playing with LVS &#8211; so that I don&#8217;t have to connect to individual Cassandra server.</p>
<p>What I planned for LVS:</p>
<ul>
<li>192.168.1.99 will be VIP</li>
<li>f5 (192.168.1.205) will be LVS director &#8230; you are right, its name is f5 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>f1 (192.168.1.101) to f4 (192.168.1.104) will be real server</li>
<li>will do DR mode (I think it is called single-B on most L4 switches &#8230;)</li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration is actually pretty simple, as long as you get it right, on LVS director (f5):</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure VIP to eth0:0 as an alias, netmask should be 255.255.255.255, broadcast is VIP itself</li>
<li>Add following rules with ipvsadm (yea &#8230; you need to install this package)<br />
-A -t 192.168.1.99:9160 -s wlc<br />
-a -t 192.168.1.99:9160 -r 192.168.1.101:9160 -g -w 1<br />
-a -t 192.168.1.99:9160 -r 192.168.1.102:9160 -g -w 1<br />
-a -t 192.168.1.99:9160 -r 192.168.1.103:9160 -g -w 1<br />
-a -t 192.168.1.99:9160 -r 192.168.1.104:9160 -g -w 1</li>
<li>Start LVS (after restart network to make sure VIP is effective) by &#8220;ipvsadm &#8211;start-daemon master&#8221;</li>
<li>If you want to stop LVS you can do &#8220;ipvsadm &#8211;stop-daemon master&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let&#8217;s turn to real servers &#8211; all real servers (f1~f4) are doing the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add these lines to /etc/sysctl.conf and then do a &#8220;sysctl -p&#8221;<br />
net.ipv4.conf.dummy0.arp_ignore = 1<br />
net.ipv4.conf.dummy0.arp_announce = 2<br />
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore = 1<br />
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_announce = 2</li>
<li>Configure VIP to dummy0 as an alias, netmask should be 255.255.255.255, broadcast is VIP itself</li>
<li>Change ThriftAddress in storage-conf.xml for Cassandra, to 0.0.0.0 so that Thrift serves on all interfaces</li>
<li>Remember to restart Cassandra so to make new configuration takes effect</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, launch your favorite client, connecting to 192.168.1.99:9160, you should get everything as if connect to individual server.</p>
