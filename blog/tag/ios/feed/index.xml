										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After several days stuck in various problems, it seems I&#8217;m making progress now.</p>
<p>First good news came from financial side &#8230; I found <a href="http://www.MacInCloud.com/">this site</a> which is good for on-demand Mac &#8220;rental&#8221;, and obviously it saved me at least $200 (if I was to go with a refurbished Mac Mini). Now I just leave $30 in my account, and occasionally log on to build my Apps. It was said that you have to log in at least every 60 days, or your money will be gone, this makes sense to me and does not bother me at all.<span id="more-1599"></span></p>
<p>Here comes things regarding development. AWS changed something, AWSiOSSDK became legacy and people should go with each individual framework for EC2, S3, and so on. Also, universal credential is no longer preferred and should create different virtual users for different access (this is really a great news!). I had made some changes to the aws-manager code, made EC2 works but S3 part still has some problem that I haven&#8217;t figured out why, but anyhow, this is a great progress, I just need to spend another hour or two to get this fixed.</p>
<p>ISAPI filter is making great progress, at least my simple filter works now, although it just does an unconditional redirect. Actually this should have been working at least a week ago, but &#8230; I stupidly change Visual Studio Express&#8217; setting, made a Debug build actually output everything to a Release directory, so all my efforts to make things work doesn&#8217;t make sense at all. I still could not recall why I made the change, but most likely at the time I started play with VS and I&#8217;m not that familiar with it. However, all the time spent on the debug was not a waste, as there are so many things I learnt <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; 32bit filter on 64bit IIS, attach to debug, different APIs, and so on.</p>
<p>I also complete conditional setting for Nginx filter, this was done in Apache module quite a while back but I was just too lazy to add the feature to Nginx. It was actually less then 20 lines of code, though.</p>
<p>Another thing is not so great but anyhow a good news, is that I decided to play with Scala and will be using Lift as the web framework. I will spend some time on this to get familiar with Java Web, then I can write my filter for Servlet Containers.</p>
<p>Maybe I can make all filters up and running by the end of this month? Let&#8217;s see :).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just upgraded Xcode to 4.5.2 through App Store, which has iOS6 support, I don&#8217;t know what else this new version includes though &#8230;</p>
<p>And after the upgrade, I got some time playing with previous AWS project which list my stuffs on AWS, include S3 and EC2. Obviously, every time I access my old codes I could find something wrong, and there is no exception this time &#8211; at the time I was doing AWS project, I had only 2 instances staying in one region, and now I have multiple (5?) instances staying in two regions so previous logic does not work very well.</p>
<p>Not many details to talk about here, I simply list all regions for AWS, and query instances targeting each endpoint, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Now my AWS app is working well again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The AWS App on iOS is pretty much done, at least I have made readonly part of S3 and EC2 works, and I don&#8217;t think write operations (create, update, delete, etc) are feasible to mobile phones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m moving to Windows Phone now, trying to build up similar App in term of functionality &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if I can build things with similar UI since different app store may have totally different tastes/rules on UI standard, better follow what they asked for.</p>
<p>I wish Windows Phone development will be easier thinking of I&#8217;ve done .Net/Visual Studio development before, let&#8217;s see &#8211; I give myself 2 weeks, and will spend no more than an hour per day.</p>
<p>Actually I tried both Android and Windows Phone the other day, trying to get basic idea of development. Obviously I don&#8217;t like Android, either because of I&#8217;m not a Java fan, or because of ugly interface of Eclipse &#8211; it may only be that ugly on OSX though, but I don&#8217;t have space (read: memory) to launch such a fat IDE in my Windows VM so leave it to the last.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here comes 3rd wave &#8230;</p>
<p>1. compare strings<br />
   It seems NSString did not overload the compare operator (==), or maybe Object-C does not have this kind of idea, so don&#8217;t use == to compare strings, instead, you need to use compare: or caseInsensitiveCompare: and their dialects.</p>
<p>2. catching cell selection event in a table view<br />
   I was trying to subclass <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableViewCell_Class/Reference/Reference.html">UITableViewCell</a> to make it works, but actually don&#8217;t have to be this complicated &#8211; all that I need to do is deal with &#8220;- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath&#8221; in the table view, and this saves me a lot of effort as I don&#8217;t have to go through all the difficulties to get storyboard, etc with codes within a Cell class.</p>
<p>3. singleton, property or method?<br />
   I created a singleton class, then found in Object-C, it&#8217;s better to static method (if you can) instead of property. It takes quite a lot keystrokes to use a property, while using method is not that hard.</p>
<p>4. passing data to a view controller in a storyboard based application<br />
   &#8211; define a property of the child view controller for holding data<br />
   &#8211; in parent view controller&#8217;s prepareForSegue, set the property of the child controller<br />
   &#8211; that&#8217;s it &#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This may not be useful to others, but it bothered me quite some time, so I&#8217;d like to write it down in case some others stuck at the same place as I did.</p>
<p>getMetadataForKey calls from aws-ios-sdk, actually it:</p>
<ol>
<li>returns user defined meta data, nothing to do with s3&#8217;s meta data</li>
<li>the key used here will be prepended a &#8220;x-aws-meta-&#8220;, that is, in aws console, we will see a meta data entry keyed with &#8220;x-aws-meta-hahaha&#8221;, but in ios app you need to use &#8220;hahaha&#8221; to get the value</li>
</ol>
<p>some other interesting stuffs &#8230; don&#8217;t use S3GetObjectRequest/Response call to get object&#8217;s header information, as it will indeed download the object. Instead, you should use S3GetObjectMetadataRequest/Response.</p>
<p>To get &#8220;Expiry Date&#8221; and Â &#8220;Lifecycle Rule&#8221; information as they are shown on aws console, you need to use response&#8221;sÂ valueForHTTPHeaderField method with key &#8220;x-amz-expiration&#8221;, the parse it &#8230; I guess there should be something more easier but havenn&#8217;t figured out how. Both &#8220;expiry-date&#8221; and &#8220;rule-id&#8221; are there so you can use them, note that they can be empty so better prepare for that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here comes the second part of ios development tips which follows <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2012/01/27/ios-development-tips/">first part</a>, I&#8217;m starting over the number now so to ease my life.</p>
<p>1. How to navigate to a view in another view<br />
   &#8211; original post is here:<br />
     * <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8221787/perform-segue-on-viewdidload">dealing with views in a storyboard based application</a><br />
     * some other helpful discussions are here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8348109/how-can-i-manually-switch-between-uiviewcontrollers-in-storyboard">manually switch view controllers in storyboard</a>, and <a href="http://how-can-i-manually-switch-between-uiv.8348109.ccqq.net/">another similar topic</a><br />
   &#8211; idea<br />
     * actually the basic idea is pretty simple and straightforward &#8211; you create a new view (the one you want to display), and push it to the top of the navigationcontroller (which actually is a stack), that&#8217;s it &#8230;<br />
     * tricky part #1: this cannot be done in a viewDidLoad event as view was not fully loaded at that time so you can nothing, the place I found that is workable is viewDidAppear event<br />
     * tricky part #2: ViewController&#8217;s initWithNibName does not work &#8230; I haven&#8217;t figure out the exact reason yet but you have to use instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier comes from storyboard<br />
     * tricky part #3: nibname &#8230; gave me QUITE A LOT headache, it should be &#8220;UIViewController-<View Controller's Object ID>&#8220;, you can get the object ID from Interface Builder, in the identity inspector tab</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to write down all tips to save time in the future, some may look like naive but thinking of I&#8217;m such a newbie in iOS development, nothing was easy to me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hide keyboard whenever background touched in a storyboard<span id="more-1222"></span>
<ul>
<li>original posts are here:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Writing_iOS_5_Code_to_Hide_the_iPhone_Keyboard">hide keyboard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1823317/how-do-i-legally-get-the-current-first-responder-on-the-screen-on-an-iphone">get current first responder</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>idea:
<ul>
<li>Change the specific view from UIView to UIControl so to enable interactive, this has to be done by selecting the view from docking area instead of the Interface Builder to me</li>
<li>add a method to resignFirstResponder for current first responder</li>
<li>link the event to the method, this can be done in Connection inspector, click and drag the &#8220;+&#8221; sign on the right of &#8220;Touch Down&#8221; event to the view controller, then in the pop-up window choose the method you created just now</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Save and load simple application settings

</ul>
</li>
<li>idea:
<ul>
<li>I decided to create an object class to manipulate registries as I need to use it more than one place</li>
<li>form a file name for registry
<pre lang="objc">    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
    NSString *registryFile = [[paths objectAtIndex:0] stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"registry.file"];</pre>
</li>
<li>save to registry</li>
<pre lang="objc">    NSMutableDictionary *dict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc]  init];
    [dict setValue:[textfield1 text] forKey:@"key1"];
    [dict setValue:[textfield2 text] forKey:@"key2"];

    [dict writeToFile:[self registryFileName] atomically:YES];</pre>
<li>load from registry
<pre lang="objc">    NSMutableDictionary *dict = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[self registryFileName]]</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>create a right button on a UINavigationItem

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2504351/how-to-add-a-button-to-uinavigationbar">add a button to uinavigationbar</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>idea
<ul>
<li>add the button after view loaded (viewDidLoad)
<pre lang="objc">    self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]
                                              initWithTitle:@"Save"
                                              style:UIBarButtonItemStyleBordered
                                              target:self
                                              action:@selector(saveKeys:)];</pre>
</li>
<li>remember create a &#8220;saveKeys&#8221; method to finish whatever you want to do, but don&#8217;t forget this: (to emulate the &#8220;Back&#8221; action since I want to close the view after &#8220;Save&#8221;)
<pre lang="objc">    [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];</pre>
</li>
<li>and reset the button while view is unloaded (viewDidUnload)
<pre lang="objc">    self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = nil;</pre>
</li>

<li>singleton

<li>dig out the concept by yourself!</li>
<li>too much code, haven&#8217;t figured out what should be posted here</li>

<p>Since I know almost nothing about either, and I&#8217;m not good at client side development at all, so I started with a not-that-complicated open source software, WordPress for iOS/Android. It&#8217;s good to see WordPress is almost the same on both platform, this will help me a lot in future work.</p>
<p>The bad thing is, WordPress does not have too many features, such as animation, and so on (sorry all that I know about &#8220;fancy&#8221; is animation &#8230;), so I can only learn basic coding stuffs, but I think it is good enough for now. Anyway it is a API based &#8220;flat&#8221; App, which has a pretty wide market &#8211; think about Amazon AWS manager (I need this), E*Trade App (I&#8217;m using this), and GMail client, etc. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s see what we have now from the Christmas &#8211; a Bambook, a Kindle, a Kindle Fire, a Samsung phone (running Windows Phone), pretty much all popular mobile devices are in my house now (yes, iPhone and iPad came from last year).</p>
<p>I can say all mobile OS&#8217;s are good enough, though iOS is having better operational features, Aneroid is rich of free Apps, and Windows Phone is just &#8230; cute? Sorry I don&#8217;t know what can exactly describe it, but its look and feel is nice.</p>
<p>I think I need to spend some time follow Windows Phone while playing with iOS and Android, will be busy.</p>
<p>(This post was sent from Kindle Fire with WordPress App for Android.)</p>
