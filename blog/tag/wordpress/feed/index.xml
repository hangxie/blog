										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu 22.04 was <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-22-04-lts-released">just released</a>, I managed to upgrade my WordPress site (running on VM and only <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2022/03/04/move-to-static-site/">publish static site</a>), it was not as smooth as I thought, there were quite some small problems here and there, but eventually it worked after like 4 hours of troubleshooting, and so on.</p>
<p>As a side note, I no longer running Parallels since I found it tricked me to subscription which involves $79.99 per year, luckily I noticed the weird charge on my credit card so was able to cancel it the same day. I&#8217;m running my VM on <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> now, I didn&#8217;t notice performance difference between UTM and Parallels, though Parallels does provide more convenient features like desktop integration, snapshot, etc.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve been running Ubuntu since 10.04, but I&#8217;m seriously thinking of moving away from it now due to snap, there are more and more applications over Ubuntu dropped deb support and are solely on snap only, I don&#8217;t mind a distro changes its package management tool like yum to dnf, but I just don&#8217;t want to have 2 package management mechanism at the same time.</p>
<p>I may not run Fedora as I need LTS, I cannot choose Rocky as it (actually RHEL) lacks of aarch64 support. Most likely I&#8217;m going to play with Debian or Arch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several things happened in the past a couple years so I moved this blog site to static, some major issues lead to this change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google is no longer my preferred service provider, so I&#8217;m moving away from AdSense and Analytics</li>
<li>I&#8217;m no longer actively writing so I don&#8217;t expect people interact with me through this site</li>
<li>Google is going to stop G Suite legacy so I assume they will stop GCE free tier soon, which I&#8217;m running this site at</li>
</ul>
<p>For now I have an VM running Ubuntu with WordPress installed, I launch the VM whenever I want to write something, then using <a href="https://www.simplystatic.co/">Simply Static</a> to generate pure static pages then copy to an Nginx server. The Nginx is still running on GCE but since everything&#8217;s static, I can easily port it to anywhere cheap whenever needed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve disabled most dynamic features during this process, like search, comment, AdSense, Analytics, etc. There may be some features that are currently broken, I will fix them whenever I know.</p>

<p>Anyway, will keep watching this for some time but it&#8217;s definitely not urgent and important &#8230; I think all I&#8217;ve got from Google for more than a year is less than $10, sure, it&#8217;s not Google&#8217;s problem, it&#8217;s me not getting the site popular :D.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know this could be a crazy thing, but why not? Especially I have a Mac in hand so that I can do both at the same time.</p>
<p>Since I know almost nothing about either, and I&#8217;m not good at client side development at all, so I started with a not-that-complicated open source software, WordPress for iOS/Android. It&#8217;s good to see WordPress is almost the same on both platform, this will help me a lot in future work.</p>
<p>The bad thing is, WordPress does not have too many features, such as animation, and so on (sorry all that I know about &#8220;fancy&#8221; is animation &#8230;), so I can only learn basic coding stuffs, but I think it is good enough for now. Anyway it is a API based &#8220;flat&#8221; App, which has a pretty wide market &#8211; think about Amazon AWS manager (I need this), E*Trade App (I&#8217;m using this), and GMail client, etc. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s see what we have now from the Christmas &#8211; a Bambook, a Kindle, a Kindle Fire, a Samsung phone (running Windows Phone), pretty much all popular mobile devices are in my house now (yes, iPhone and iPad came from last year).</p>
<p>I can say all mobile OS&#8217;s are good enough, though iOS is having better operational features, Aneroid is rich of free Apps, and Windows Phone is just &#8230; cute? Sorry I don&#8217;t know what can exactly describe it, but its look and feel is nice.</p>
<p>I think I need to spend some time follow Windows Phone while playing with iOS and Android, will be busy.</p>
<p>(This post was sent from Kindle Fire with WordPress App for Android.)</p>

<p>The wordpress application is really cool, it could be the best wordpress app I&#8217;ve ever used.</p>
