Well, this does not mean I can solve the problem :D. After (accidently) upgraded Xcode to 4.3, I have to install a nightly build version of CMake to get rid of the &#8220;-buildstyle&#8221; problem, then spent quite some time on trying to build mscore from scratch, but so far no luck.<\/p>\n<p>This morning I asked myself, WHY?
