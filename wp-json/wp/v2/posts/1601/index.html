So it&#8217;s 2M hours span to 7~9am and 6~8pm, 4 hours. I would like to assume it is evenly distributed, this makes the concurrent online user &#8230; 500K, Not a big number, and since it is just a non-key feature, so activities will be limited.<\/p>\n<p>So I think I&#8217;d go with a full replicated ejabberd cluster, &#8220;full&#8221; means I&#8217;m going to replicate everything &#8211; password, roster, offline message. I will check the stats of the production environment to see how the resource utilization is going, and tune the allocation whenever necessary.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Regarding the setup, pretty straightforward once I went through once (I did test on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but production eventually will be CentOS6):<\/p>\n<p>1. setup node#1, change host (actually, it is domain for the XMPP service) in \/etc\/ejabberd\/ejabberd.cfg, add mod_http_bind to modules (so to enable http-bind and http-poll), and change EJABBERD_NODE from &#8216;ejabberd&#8217; to &#8216;ejabberd@`hostname -f`&#8217; in \/etc\/default\/ejabberd. You need to remove everything (except .erlang.cookie) under \/var\/lib\/ejabberd then restart so to have the right mnesia DB.<br \/>\n2. setup node#2, same as node#1, before restart ejabberd, copy .erlang.cookie from node#1<br \/>\n3. run &#8220;ejabberdctl debug&#8221; as ejabberd, then:<br \/>\n<code><br \/>\nFirstNode = 'ejabberd@node#1', mnesia:stop(), mnesia:delete_schema([node()]), mnesia:start(), mnesia:change_config(extra_db_nodes, [FirstNode]), mnesia:change_table_copy_type(schema, node(), disc_copies).<br \/>\n<\/code><br \/>\nnote that node#1 should be FQDN<br \/>\n4. CTRL-C twice to quit (q(). used to work, but I don&#8217;t know what changed to erlang which makes it no longer works), then restart ejabberd. Run &#8220;ejabberdctl status&#8221; and &#8220;ejabberd mnesia info&#8221; to make sure the service is properly running on this host, and it is has node#1 included in DB node<br \/>\n5. repeat 2~4 on all other nodes (I have 4 nodes in total)<br \/>\n6. after all set, you can go to http:\/\/node#1:5280\/admin\/ to make sure all nodes are in the cluster<\/p>\n<p>Now &#8230; I believe it&#8217;s doable in ejabberdctl debug, but still could not figure out how. However, it&#8217;s easier to do it through web admin interface. I just change everything exactly the same as node#1 on all other nodes (RAM, disc, disc and RAM, etc). After that, do a reboot on all machines then use ejabberdctl status (or even with &#8211;nodes Node#N) to make sure everything can be up and running after a reboot.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to do LVS for XMPP port and nginx load balancer for 5280 (http-bind), will post result later.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time to play with HA ejabberd setup now.
