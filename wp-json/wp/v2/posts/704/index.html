MySQL is kind of slow to me though I have pretty much experience in setting it up, include replication, etc, and I will check to see if all applications can be done in a key-value based data store (check below). OpenLDAP is another story, I still haven&#8217;t figure out how to set it up with replication &#8211; last time I tried was 2.2\/2.3, but 2.4 introduces a whole new approach to do replication and I think I&#8217;m going to leave it untouched for now. Note that I still need to come back to LDAP later on since it is still perfect solution for running corporate-like application, such as what I did couple of times before &#8211; integrate mail, IM, wiki, blog, etc together with single user-id.<\/p>\n<p>OK, back to NoSQL, couple of things to do:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Consistent hashing, I still need to read all those articles and try out different implementation, I don&#8217;t think I will compose my own, but I need something can work on Linux and Windows (OSX? Don&#8217;t think so), and support some major programming languages (C\/C++, PHP\/Python, Java). I also need to do test similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/xiehang.com\/blog\/2009\/10\/23\/nosql-start-with-consistent-hashing\/\">what I&#8217;ve done<\/a> and understand how it affects deployment.<\/li>\n<li>Try out different engines, most likely I won&#8217;t try out things too fancy (read it &#8220;complicated&#8221;), for example, I will prefer Redis over memcachedb just because memcachedb&#8217;s replication is not that simple to me, I believe anything complicate in setup will be a headache in maintenance. I will also skip those so-called document store\/graph store unless they can support simple key-value store in same performance (then those features will be a nice add-on). I don&#8217;t have the list so far, but I will get one in the coming weekend. Things to be tested include installation, replication, fail-over, backup and recovery, monitoring, etc. Also programming language supported will be another important factor, I wish a similar list to item #1.<\/li>\n<li>Application &#8230; I&#8217;m going to conclude &#8220;traditional&#8221; web features that involves data store, and check to see how to implement them in distributed key-value data store. For example, user registration, login, edit preference\/profile is one of the fundamental features, and buddy related operation (add as buddy, blacklist, check online status, notify buddy for event\/be notified by buddy) is another one. Things current in my mind include message feature (internal\/external IM\/mail), post features (threaded post like forum, vote\/survey may be in this category as well), and maybe some search features. I don&#8217;t think I can come up with a full list in the coming days, but I will keep posting here.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is pretty much what&#8217;s in my mind. All these stuffs are seems to be new and almost none of them are well packaged, so after 4~5 years of using yum\/apt, now I need to do what I used to do &#8211; build everything from scratch, if I have time, I will compose some packages so to ease my deployment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve read too many articles talking about this NoSQL stuffs, now I have to have a plan to proceed (with what? :-W).
