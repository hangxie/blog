However, it does not handle Chinese-English-mixed word properly, as it just take out English (Latin) words and return it as token, thus you can never extract words like U\u76d8 or T\u6064 (sorry for Chinese here, the first words is USB disk, and the second is T-Shirt).<\/p>\n<p>I got suggestion from a colleague that treat Latin words as Chinese character, I found this solution was really simple, neat, and easy to implement.
