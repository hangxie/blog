However, it seems godaddy&#8217;s default PHP is still PHP4 so have to set alias to make sure symfony script is interpreted by PHP5 instead of PHP4:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>alias symfony=&#8217;\/usr\/local\/php5\/bin\/php \/path\/to\/symfony-1.2.7\/data\/bin\/symfony&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>after this, I got the problem, saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\/usr\/local\/php5\/bin\/php: Symbol `client_errors&#8217; has different size in shared object, consider re-linking<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and turned out it was because of mysql client lib problem &#8211; I don&#8217;t know the detail yet, but seems \/usr\/local\/php5\/bin\/php and \/web\/cgi-bin\/php5 are both linked to \/usr\/lib\/mysql\/libmysqlclient.so.15, which works for \/web one but not the \/usr one. I did some tests and found \/usr\/lib\/libmysqlclient.so.14.0.0 works perfect with \/usr\/local\/php5\/bin\/php, so put this into my .bash_profile:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>LD_PRELOAD=\/usr\/lib\/libmysqlclient.so.14.0.0<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>note that \/usr\/lib\/libmysqlclient.so.10.0.0 doesn&#8217;t work well as it&#8217;s too old to support modern (new) password encrypt\/authentication.<\/p>\n<p>By now I can use symfony do the development job, but problem are still there while I&#8217;m trying to browse from browser, the first thing is rewrite rules &#8211; these lines should be uncommented from web\/.htaccess:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RewriteBase \/<br \/>\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\..+$<br \/>\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\\.html$<br \/>\nRewriteRule .* &#8211; [L]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>then I met the problem (which took me longest time to solve) with error:<br \/>\nEmpty module and\/or action after parsing the URL &#8220;\/index.php&#8221; (\/).<br \/>\nactually I should have got it solve earlier if I search on the web, there is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codemassacre.com\/2009\/03\/17\/problems-hosting-symfony-12-sites-on-godaddy\/\">a great article talking about the solution<\/a>, and my problem got solved just after 1st part of solution mentioned by the blog &#8211; adding following lines to &#8220;all&#8221; section of apps\/frontend\/config\/factories.yml:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>request:\r\n  param:\r\n    path_info_key: REQUEST_URI<\/pre>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>be careful with intending, original blog seems not doing the right thing and put &#8220;request&#8221; and &#8220;param&#8221; in same level, which is wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Alright, by this time you will be able to play with symfony on shared hosting with godaddy. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Though problems I&#8217;m going to discuss are for symfony 1.2, I guess it applicable to 1.0 and 1.1 as well.
