I&#8217;m checking software installed on my laptop now, so that I have some rough idea of what ability I&#8217;m going to lose by switching to Mac.<\/p>\n<p>I believe I&#8217;m still going to have MS Office, and I will still have Firefox and Thunderbird, I will have Yahoo Messenger, and I think Adium can do all Pidgin does. I don&#8217;t think I need putty and WinSCP. I assume I can still get software for Blackberry and Nokia E90, but if they are not available it won&#8217;t be a big deal. I will have Perl, python, Java, subversion, etc. by default, which is good.<\/p>\n<p>I may lose GNAT Ada, and have to find a better Common LISP environment. I need to find a good media player, while i think VLC should be good enough. Obviously I will lose all those Windows development environment, but if I can get Fusion I could run a Windows image (not sure about corp IT policy though). A new printer (all-in-on) is on the way and I believe it works with Mac (my current one does not work quite well).<\/p>\n<p>Pretty much everything is fine :). I will submit the ticket after coming back from the Christmas vacation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was said corp IT is now able to switch HP laptop with a MacBook, there is a guy in our group got his MacBook, and another guy&#8217;s request is being handled and will get in &#8220;couple of days&#8221;.
