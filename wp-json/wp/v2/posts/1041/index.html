I used to get some breakfast on my way to office but I may try to find something new. I&#8217;m still skipping most of my lunches, and for dinner I had it with colleague (that will be a rich dinner) or have it alone (most time, it&#8217;s just a bowl of noodle).<\/p>\n<p>Weather here in Shanghai is horrible, but seems I can still live with it, since I spend more of my time in office or at home, which means I have air conditioner for almost all the time. The only tough time is whenever I went out for smoking, but anyway that&#8217;s not healthy so let&#8217;s take it as punishment.<\/p>\n<p>Business wise &#8230; things are just ok. It&#8217;s a big company now so it is not the pure start-up model that I was expecting, but things are still moving forward and I&#8217;m feeling busy now &#8211; after almost 2 years of &#8220;nothing to do&#8221;. I&#8217;m hiring, but I failed couple of times to get a product manager, so I think I&#8217;m going to focus on existing people, try to push some kids to see if they can grow fast enough. Engineer wise it&#8217;s mixed &#8211; I have problem in hiring expert on mail protocol (SMTP, POP, etc) as it is not that popular now but I have no problem finding people who want to do backend stuffs (distributed storage, etc), I didn&#8217;t pay too much attention on front-end engineer as it won&#8217;t be too bad, but I need to grab at least on in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n<p>There are some business deals that I&#8217;m working on but I cannot share with public, but they are all moving smoothly. The BD manager who&#8217;s working with me is really really really smart, helped me striked pretty good deals and moving things forward even faster than I was expecting. He got a girl helping him now, and I wish the rest of the business negotiation will be as good as before.<\/p>\n<p>Back to product, I have to prepare product plan due to lacking of product manager. Good thing is that I can learn to prepare those stuffs though I&#8217;ve been reading those B.S. for so many times, bad thing is that it&#8217;s time consuming.<\/p>\n<p>Pretty much everything that I have at this moment, I will give out more things later on, once I have some.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been away from this site for quite some time, there is only one reason for that\u00a0&#8211; BUSY.
