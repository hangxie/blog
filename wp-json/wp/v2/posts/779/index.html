It seems to me the most reasonable plan to consolidate computers at home is getting a new iMac, let it be the home desktop, running all photo\/video editing, storage massive data, etc, and take the current home desktop (which is a 4-core desktop) and then retire the PowerBook (maybe leave it running somewhere? Anyway it does not occupy too much space) and the P4 box, and turning current dual-core machine as the second Window machine at home, pity I don&#8217;t think it can run Windows 7.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trying to search online for an affordable 8-cores machine, but now I&#8217;m asking myself &#8211; why?
