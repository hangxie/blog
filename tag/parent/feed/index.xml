										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ADSL @ my parents&#8217; house was crappy &#8211; it disconnected every 2~20 minutes, which made it impossible to me to get things done.</p>
<p>Technician from the carrier came on Friday and did all sort of tests, and pointed out the ADSL modem is the one to be blamed. However, they don&#8217;t have anything in stock so I have to get my own from a shop.</p>
<p>It was the afternoon with thunderstorm, I decided I would like with the bad connection for a day or two instead of risking myself stuck somewhere around (yea, flood in downtown and traffic was super bad), anyway it was just half a day, and after I replaced the broken one with the new one I got, everything works like a charm.</p>
<p>Alright, I have my connection again, and (re-) started my so-called boring life by surfing online and checking emails &#8230; yes, there were more than 3 people told me I&#8217;m wasting my vacation and I sort of agree with them.</p>
