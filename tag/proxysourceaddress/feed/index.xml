<p>I have a machine with 4 IPs (216.x.x.203~206), and start Apache listening on 1203~1206 for each IP, then for each VirtualHost (such as 216.x.x.203:1203) I turn on ProxyRequests, and set ProxySourceAddress to that IP address, thus client connecting to 203 will have their request go out through 203 as well.<span id="more-1674"></span></p>
<p>It just didn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m having this kind of messages in error_log:<br />
<code><br />
(98)Address already in use: [client 192.168.0.11:48822] AH00938: CONNECT: failed to bind socket to local address<br />
</code></p>
<p>Tried various configuration changes but didn&#8217;t make any difference. Since I was in a hurry to get my job done, so I switch to squid &#8211; everything was up and running as expected in ~15 min. Thinking of I never play with squid before, I have to say, squid is pretty user (read: admin) friendly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve downloaded code from for httpd-2.4.7, and will dig in to see if it was because of my potential stupid mistakes, let&#8217;s see how things work. </p>
