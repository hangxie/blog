										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made Cisco VPN works on my MacBook, accidentally &#8230;</p>
<p>I was talking to someone while randomly clicked on company&#8217;s web VPN site, and while discussing something I blindly clicked here and there and found that Advanced VPN does not work on my Mac, it soon took my attention and in several minutes, I figured it should be privilege issue (at least I guess). After manually download the installation shell script and run it with sudo, everything&#8217;s working now.</p>
<p>However, I used to start Cisco VPN on the Windows XP virtual machine running inside VirtualBox, it seems with the VPN moved to Mac itself (which is the host machine for VirtualBox), it became slower, significantly slower than before. I haven&#8217;t got time to dig out what was happening, but anyway, it is acceptable.</p>
