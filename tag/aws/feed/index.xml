										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working for the big chip company now, sound a little bit weird, though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m sitting in backend team focusing on DevOps, I guess I will be in this mixed role till we find a dedicated DevOps guy. I guess whenever that happens, I&#8217;ve already finished monitoring facility (plus logistical stuffs like on-call schedule, etc.), and should have finished the plan to migrate from Rackspace to AWS.</p>
<p>Everything works smoothly so far except git &#8211; I admit current company is using git in a modern way, but I don&#8217;t think previous company was doing something wrong. Anyway, I believe people do have different ideas of how to use git, I just have to fit into the company&#8217;s style.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite like saltstack although I&#8217;m still trying to get familiar with it. However, before I raise this as a concern to the team, I&#8217;d like to make sure everything that saltstack is doing can be done by cfengine.</p>
<p>Ah yea, also need to evaluate <a href="http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/">Shinken</a> as it&#8217;s a pure Python solution, and &#8220;we are a python house&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trying to merge everything running on AWS to a single instance, and once the instance is good enough to run all my stuffs, will book a reserved instance to save cost.</p>
<p>It seems I&#8217;m having less and less sites up and running, I got impression that I used to have 10+ sites flying around for random purposes but now I have only 2 &#8220;serious&#8221; sites. Sure I still have 2 or 3 sites running test environments but they can be discarded anytime.</p>
<p>The company is moving to AWS as I was told, could be a good time to start look around things like VPC, etc.</p>

<p>And after the upgrade, I got some time playing with previous AWS project which list my stuffs on AWS, include S3 and EC2. Obviously, every time I access my old codes I could find something wrong, and there is no exception this time &#8211; at the time I was doing AWS project, I had only 2 instances staying in one region, and now I have multiple (5?) instances staying in two regions so previous logic does not work very well.</p>
<p>Not many details to talk about here, I simply list all regions for AWS, and query instances targeting each endpoint, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Now my AWS app is working well again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The AWS App on iOS is pretty much done, at least I have made readonly part of S3 and EC2 works, and I don&#8217;t think write operations (create, update, delete, etc) are feasible to mobile phones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m moving to Windows Phone now, trying to build up similar App in term of functionality &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if I can build things with similar UI since different app store may have totally different tastes/rules on UI standard, better follow what they asked for.</p>
<p>I wish Windows Phone development will be easier thinking of I&#8217;ve done .Net/Visual Studio development before, let&#8217;s see &#8211; I give myself 2 weeks, and will spend no more than an hour per day.</p>
<p>Actually I tried both Android and Windows Phone the other day, trying to get basic idea of development. Obviously I don&#8217;t like Android, either because of I&#8217;m not a Java fan, or because of ugly interface of Eclipse &#8211; it may only be that ugly on OSX though, but I don&#8217;t have space (read: memory) to launch such a fat IDE in my Windows VM so leave it to the last.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This may not be useful to others, but it bothered me quite some time, so I&#8217;d like to write it down in case some others stuck at the same place as I did.</p>
<p>getMetadataForKey calls from aws-ios-sdk, actually it:</p>
<ol>
<li>returns user defined meta data, nothing to do with s3&#8217;s meta data</li>
<li>the key used here will be prepended a &#8220;x-aws-meta-&#8220;, that is, in aws console, we will see a meta data entry keyed with &#8220;x-aws-meta-hahaha&#8221;, but in ios app you need to use &#8220;hahaha&#8221; to get the value</li>
</ol>
<p>some other interesting stuffs &#8230; don&#8217;t use S3GetObjectRequest/Response call to get object&#8217;s header information, as it will indeed download the object. Instead, you should use S3GetObjectMetadataRequest/Response.</p>
<p>To get &#8220;Expiry Date&#8221; and Â &#8220;Lifecycle Rule&#8221; information as they are shown on aws console, you need to use response&#8221;sÂ valueForHTTPHeaderField method with key &#8220;x-amz-expiration&#8221;, the parse it &#8230; I guess there should be something more easier but havenn&#8217;t figured out how. Both &#8220;expiry-date&#8221; and &#8220;rule-id&#8221; are there so you can use them, note that they can be empty so better prepare for that.</p>
