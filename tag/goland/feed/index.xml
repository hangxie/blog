										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read from reddit that JetBrains offer <a href="https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360016581839-What-is-an-OSS-development-license-and-who-qualifies-for-one-">free license of their IDE to FOSS projects</a>, applied, got approved in a couple of day, and I&#8217;m playing with Goland now. The process could be even faster if I expose my email over github.com, so JetBrains did not have to reach out to me for the verification (licenses bound to email).</p>
<p>I just used it for a day and still trying to change my mindset from VS Code to Goland although both are quite alike, something made me feel weird when I started with Goland includes it collapses &#8220;import&#8221; section by default, it feels so &#8220;java-ish&#8221;, and it does not automatically add/remove import whenever code changes, I also missed vim compatible mode as I use vim more than any other editors include VS code.</p>
<p>The screen looks a bit crowded especially when I launched debug, which is understandable as 1. there are lots of details to be shown during debug, and 2. I&#8217;m on my 13 inch Macbook Air. I&#8217;m going to try this on a larger screen and I&#8217;m also going to try if license works for Windows as well.</p>
