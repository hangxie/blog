										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It used to be one of the most reliable and cute (or cool?) service on the Web, but seems not any more.</p>
<p>I tried to move two of my sites to Google App, but had to give up because all sorts of troubles it gave to me. Yesterday I was able to move one site to it, but at the last step (to activate my E-Mail account, I guess), it kept telling my my Google account was webmaster@gmail.com and I cannot change it. I tried to move to webmaster@mydomain.com but failed due to it had been registered, and if I want to hook up with this existing account it told me that I need to use webmaster@gmail.com. I was totally lost of what I should do, so I simply removed my domain from it.</p>
<p>It seems Google needs sometime to finish the work of removing my site as I no longer can register it, so I tried another domain I own, which is currently running on some other service providers (free, as well). Now Google is doing much better &#8230; I mentioned much better because it simply give me &#8220;Server error&#8221; (I guess it is HTTP 5xx but I&#8217;m not sure), so I don&#8217;t have to go through all the registration process and stuck in some middle way, hehe.</p>
<p>So, good-bye to Google App, for now, I will come back and check things out later on, maybe weeks, maybe months.</p>
<p>BTW, it could be Google is not willing to provide free service any more, so Google&#8217;s technical team should not be blamed, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve made some progress, I want to write it down here so that I can follow up tomorrow (actually, today):</p>
<ul>
<li>Python is not that easy, but it is not that difficult, I&#8217;ve decided to use wsgi plus web.py to do my web development, I think wsgi is the right way to go, but web.py is still a question mark &#8211; I picked it up just because it is simple</li>
<li>Tuned Apache configuration to make it support wsgi/web.py, actually I was thinking of finding something else which will be lighter, I still need to do some more research on that but since I&#8217;m using wsgi so I don&#8217;t think changing web server will affect anything, other than deployment.</li>
<li>I found a place to host subversion, freely. Using version control can easily track changes, and remote repository will make sure my stuffs are safe. Free service does not guarantee 100% reliability, but thinking of I have local copy already, it&#8217;s acceptable</li>
</ul>

<p>After going through various sources, I decided to stay with ESXi for a while, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will be free to me for 60 days (well, another 58 days indeed)</li>
<li>Xen is not that easy to be setup as I can see, need to learn more</li>
<li>VMWare Go just announced today and I will take a try later on to see how it works</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, running 6 VMs on a dual-core/3G mem machine is acceptable, I&#8217;m going to launch more tests on this box and will remove my VMs on Virtual box soon.</p>
