<p>I read another post, cannot recall details, that somebody had built and been selling Android watch. I think having a Android watch is not that useful unless it is a watch-phone as well, since people still prefer connected on their way, but if some one can build a Android wall clock and use wifi to connect, that wil be great, isn&#8217;t it? Think about it &#8211; I used to put my cell phone, pad, and laptop in another room while I was watching TV (this makes sense, isn&#8217;t it?), and used to forget what I should do which was set up in Google calendar, now if a wal clock can remind me (it&#8217;s just there on the wall), that will be great, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Will search around &#8230;</p>
