<p>I was playing with <a href="http://musescore.org/">MuseScore</a> which is an open source alternative to Overture, however it kept crashing while open some specific ove files. After searching around and reading some posts, you must have guessed what I did &#8211; checkout source codes and start building.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun, I guess that saying was correct &#8211; programmers used to want to face problems that hard to solve. Well, this does not mean I can solve the problem :D. After (accidently) upgraded Xcode to 4.3, I have to install a nightly build version of CMake to get rid of the &#8220;-buildstyle&#8221; problem, then spent quite some time on trying to build mscore from scratch, but so far no luck.</p>
<p>This morning I asked myself, WHY? Let&#8217;s forget about what was being debated in my mind, but now I decided to give it up, at last before I can finish my term extraction project which can help me make living, for real.</p>
<p>In the mean while, I will postpone all mobile development for several weeks. Actually I made pretty good progress with Windows Phone 7 development, and it won&#8217;t take me too long to finish a WP version for my AWS client, but I want to push it to late April.</p>
<p>Focus please, you cannot solve every single problem you meet.</p>
