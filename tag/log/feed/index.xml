										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was asked to find a solution to write customized Apache log entry (in Apache access log, not error log), other requirements include easy to use, which implicitly means &#8220;PHP friendly&#8221;, and flexible, which means &#8220;free format&#8221; and &#8220;may or may not have the value&#8221;.</p>
<p>Seriously, the first thing jumped into my mind was an Apache module (let&#8217;s hack mod_log!) or a PHP extension, but later on I found that &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to maintain another orphan project especially it will be orphan since nobody want to touch it after it&#8217;s up and running (I have one already, which does some cookie stuffs). So I move on to Google &#8230;</p>
<p>Then I found <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.apache-note.php">apache_note()</a>, plus <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a> (search for <code>%{<var>Foobar</var>}n</code>), all that I need to do is tell PHP guys to call this function, and tell ops guys to setup Apache log properly, we are all set.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see apache_note can change the note as many times as you want, whenever the request is finished on server side, the final data will be written to log.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got 700K lines of apache log files from a friend&#8217;s web server and imported them to the testing Hadoop instance running on my MacBoox, following the instructions listed <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted">here</a> I successfully run some analysis.</p>
<p>Note, the last section in the article talking about the </i>Apache Weblog Data</i> doesn&#8217;t seem to be correct &#8211; it lacks of some space (&#8221; &#8220;) after ^ and it gave me quite some headache since I&#8217;m not familiar with Java regular expressions. Luckily <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-662">Hive issue 662</a> mentioned in the article gave me the correct regex to get things done.</p>
<p>It seems I can only learn to play with Hive/Hadoop cos Hadoop running on MacBook is still a single node installation which is &#8230; <b>SLOW</b>, but so far I&#8217;m fine with it as I don&#8217;t have high volume of data to be processed. As a reference, getting top accessed IPs (which I used to figure out potential abusers) took 83 seconds. The HSQL is simple, something like &#8220;select host, count(*) cc from apachelog group by host order by cc desc limit 10;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hadoop is a richmen&#8217;s game, seems it only improve the performance whenever you have lots of nodes as it can well distributed tasks.</p>
<p>BTW, <i>Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</i> is a good book <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
