<p>Well, it&#8217;s because of corporate cares more about process, care about how much time people spent, either want to track workload, or just want to make sure employees are doing real jobs. On the other size, startups care about getting things done, they really don&#8217;t care, or have no time to care about workload, and trust people in the company are willing to take things whenever they are free.</p>
<p>I would like to see how other people think about this.</p>
