					<description><![CDATA[I was asked to find a solution to write customized Apache log entry (in Apache access log, not error log), other requirements include easy to use, which implicitly means &#8220;PHP friendly&#8221;, and flexible, which means &#8220;free format&#8221; and &#8220;may or may not have the value&#8221;.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was asked to find a solution to write customized Apache log entry (in Apache access log, not error log), other requirements include easy to use, which implicitly means &#8220;PHP friendly&#8221;, and flexible, which means &#8220;free format&#8221; and &#8220;may or may not have the value&#8221;.</p>
<p>Seriously, the first thing jumped into my mind was an Apache module (let&#8217;s hack mod_log!) or a PHP extension, but later on I found that &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to maintain another orphan project especially it will be orphan since nobody want to touch it after it&#8217;s up and running (I have one already, which does some cookie stuffs). So I move on to Google &#8230;</p>
<p>Then I found <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.apache-note.php">apache_note()</a>, plus <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a> (search for <code>%{<var>Foobar</var>}n</code>), all that I need to do is tell PHP guys to call this function, and tell ops guys to setup Apache log properly, we are all set.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see apache_note can change the note as many times as you want, whenever the request is finished on server side, the final data will be written to log.</p>
