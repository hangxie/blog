					<description><![CDATA[This is my naive conclusion from short time of observation, everybody hates dealing with multiple ticketing systems, and it seems to me JIRA is much more clear as a &#8220;ticketing system&#8221;, but corporate/enterprise still prefers Rally, why?

<p>Well, it&#8217;s because of corporate cares more about process, care about how much time people spent, either want to track workload, or just want to make sure employees are doing real jobs. On the other size, startups care about getting things done, they really don&#8217;t care, or have no time to care about workload, and trust people in the company are willing to take things whenever they are free.</p>
<p>I would like to see how other people think about this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are upgrading corporate E-Mail system now &#8211; it&#8217;s our first production E-Mail system :).</p>
<p>It seems there are way too many things to be tested, people are working really hard on that but it still took quite some time.</p>
<p>Now everything had been switched to the new system and we (alright, exclude myself) are busy verifying the system. It takes time, and I&#8217;m sleepy here &#8230;</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I&#8217;ll pay more attention on public E-Mail system, but I know corporate E-Mail system will kill us sooner or later based on my previous experience.</p>
