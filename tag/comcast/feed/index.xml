<p>I have to say something good about Comcast&#8217;s online team &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure which team it is, but seems there are bunch of people surfing online for all the time (with some tools) to find out any negative posts, and do follow up. I once read similar stuffs on newegg, that Asus reply to those who had negative feeling on Asus products.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going back to Comcast in nearÂ  future, but their online team&#8217;s performance really impressed me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comcast has a $69.99 promotion for Internet and cable bundle, but they refused to give me the price as I&#8217;m their subscriber already, so I ordered DirectTV and get things installed.</p>
<p>Internet is way harder &#8211; AT&amp;T does not provide service in my area, and all other providers (satellite) are way too expensive. Luckily, while I chat online with Comcast representative for canceling my cable service, he gave me a $29.99 offer (vs. current ~$50), so I accepted the offer, and stopped looking around.</p>
<p>I have to look at this again after 6 months, I don&#8217;t think anything will be changed then, I may take a look at wireless provider (AT&amp;T or Verizon), at least make it a backup plan, so that I can cancel Comcast for some days and then subscribe again as a new customer.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I think maintaining TV subscription is a waste to me, since I seldom watch TV &#8230;</p>
