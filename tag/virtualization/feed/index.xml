										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu 22.04 was <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-22-04-lts-released">just released</a>, I managed to upgrade my WordPress site (running on VM and only <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2022/03/04/move-to-static-site/">publish static site</a>), it was not as smooth as I thought, there were quite some small problems here and there, but eventually it worked after like 4 hours of troubleshooting, and so on.</p>
<p>As a side note, I no longer running Parallels since I found it tricked me to subscription which involves $79.99 per year, luckily I noticed the weird charge on my credit card so was able to cancel it the same day. I&#8217;m running my VM on <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> now, I didn&#8217;t notice performance difference between UTM and Parallels, though Parallels does provide more convenient features like desktop integration, snapshot, etc.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve been running Ubuntu since 10.04, but I&#8217;m seriously thinking of moving away from it now due to snap, there are more and more applications over Ubuntu dropped deb support and are solely on snap only, I don&#8217;t mind a distro changes its package management tool like yum to dnf, but I just don&#8217;t want to have 2 package management mechanism at the same time.</p>
<p>I may not run Fedora as I need LTS, I cannot choose Rocky as it (actually RHEL) lacks of aarch64 support. Most likely I&#8217;m going to play with Debian or Arch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time to play with Virutalization again, this time I&#8217;m using kvm on CentOS 6, which has pretty many documentation but do need to pay more attention on details &#8211; I was locked out of the box last night after changing the network setting (with mistakes for sure <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ), this should be avoided for anyone who&#8217;s going to do this. Again, stay beside your machine whenever you are to do the initial setup.</p>
<p>After network setup is done, everything else is pretty smoothy, just need to read lots of man pages to know syntax of those qemu and virt-* commands. I repeated several times by virt-install, then virsh destroy and virsh undefine, etc., then virt-install again. There should be some better way to change configuration for existing VMs but for me, it&#8217;s much more easier to run from scratch.</p>
<p>Now I have 4 VMs running on a 8-cores/32G box, it seems everything&#8217;s OK so far, but I need to do some more tests &#8211; especially performance test &#8211; before carrying on.</p>
<p>BTW, a VNC viewer plus ssh tunnel is a must to do the setup, since I still haven&#8217;t figure out how to auto-installation, i.e. touchless, or installation without manually involve the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently spent lot of time on reading articles from <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/">Linux Magazine</a>, as it always introduce pretty new (or not new, but less known) technology and products, this time it is <a href="http://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page">Proxmox</a>, an open source virtualization<em></em><a name="_15833662156934764065" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/LinuxMagazine/%7E3/P90AiCVNdqk/"></a><em><a name="_15833662156934764065" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/LinuxMagazine/%7E3/P90AiCVNdqk/"></a></em><strong></strong> product.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running VMWare Go at home at this moment, but I failed to solve the license issue and every 60 days I have to re-install everything. I guess I got the wrong ISO, so what I installed was actually for vSphere, but I just don&#8217;t want to spend too much time on digging it out as obviously VMWare does not want people get the right solution easily.</p>
<p>Xen is another story, at least to me it is not easy to use, maybe next version will be easier (I should take a try either but I lack of machines &#8230;). Also, I still have this impression that running Ubuntu with Xen is painful as it is, kind of, tightly bundled with RedHat distro.</p>
<p>Now here comes Proxmox which seems promising, I will take a try today (may be weekend as well) and then if it works I will stick with it, but if not &#8230; I will try out Xen.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to run 4 VMs on my dual core machine but actually was running nothing seriousely. A while back I read an article from Ubuntu about its cloud setup, mentioning you should not run VMs more than number of cores you have, I was laughing at the article at that time, since it sounds ridiclous &#8211; as long as CPU can handle the load, we should run as many VMs as possible and &#8211; the bottleneck seems coming freom memory to me.</p>
<p>Obviously I was wrong. Once I started testing Casasandra, I got lots of timeouts from 4 VMs, I checked memory, there was no problem  at all, i.e. every VM&#8217;s memory is in physical memory. I was also doubt Ubuntu is not doing as good as Fedore, obviously Iwas wrong either, then I recalled the article, shut down 2 VMs and &#8230; you know, things work like a chime.</p>
<p>There could be saomew thesis telling why CPU is the bottleneck, but I don&#8217;t have time to dig it out, the most important lesson I took from this case is, don&#8217;t take anythingn in granted, respect preofessional advices</p>
