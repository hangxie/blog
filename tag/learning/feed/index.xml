										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s time to go back work, National Day long holiday is ending.</p>
<p>At least I had some good sleep during the long holiday, also get some sort of &#8220;inner peace&#8221; after having the good sleep :). It seems labor work (most of them are yard work) helps a lot to get me good sleep, I will see if I can get some labor work or body exercise whenever I get back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>It will be a tough month to me as I need to finish some hard steps to re-org the team, some stuffs had been done and it seems really hurt, but like it or not, I need to get rest done in a week or two, and make everyone in the team to focus on new business.</p>
<p>To myself actually this is a good opportunity to practice those skills though I had tried before, painful learning curve.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m randomly looking around to see what I can do with my current spare time, as I&#8217;m not making good progress with PPCam project and this makes me feel bad. This becomes a good excuse to get something new :). There are really enough stuffs that I&#8217;m interested at, and I&#8217;m currently &#8220;evaluating&#8221; following areas: <a href='https://xiehang.com/blog/2009/05/30/my-random-programming-life/' class='excerpt-more'>[...]</a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m randomly looking around to see what I can do with my current spare time, as I&#8217;m not making good progress with PPCam project and this makes me feel bad. This becomes a good excuse to get something new :).</p>
<p>There are really enough stuffs that I&#8217;m interested at, and I&#8217;m currently &#8220;evaluating&#8221; following areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>embedded system &#8211; pure hardware oriented, such as robot, ARM, etc</li>
<li>Mobile &#8211; Windows CE, Symbian, embedded Linux (haven&#8217;t determined which Linux to go now :D), iPhone</li>
<li>Mac OSX &#8211; focus on pure native OSX application done by Objective-C along with Cocoa</li>
<li>Windows &#8211; focus on multimedia area with DirectShow, etc</li>
<li>Ada &#8211; this is just for language, other than PPCam I haven&#8217;t figure out what to do</li>
<li>Python &#8211; trying to see how to do Web development with it, then desktop</li>
<li>Lisp &#8211; sorry I still want to do something with it</li>
<li>Some weird stuffs like encryption, P2P, AI, etc, they can only be done with something above</li>
</ol>
<p>I may put some sort of priority to these items and then pick one or two, I will post my thinking later with comments.</p>
