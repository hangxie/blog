										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Per history, this had been there for several months, seems nagiosgraph&#8217;s rrd data updated  <strong>sometime</strong>, and it seems this related to upgrade.</p>
<p>I never paid too much attention on this as nobody else, except me, watching those performance data graphs. However, today I do need to solve this as it&#8217;s always bothering that you cannot get data whenever you do need it.</p>
<p>Long story short &#8211; and stupid me, obvious a while back whenever I applied my patch to nagios.cfg, I didn&#8217;t comment out the first process_performance_data=0, and obviously second process_performance_data=1 didn&#8217;t overwrite the first one. Also, even with process_performance_data=0 which disable performance data processing, nagios still processes performance data every time it got restarted, and this cause all mysterious problems.</p>
<p>I do believe nagios behaves wrong in this case &#8211; it&#8217;s a common sense that configuration can be overwritten by later one with same key, and if configuration tells you don&#8217;t do something, DON&#8217;T do it even in edge cases, otherwise people will get confused and made debugging really difficult.</p>
