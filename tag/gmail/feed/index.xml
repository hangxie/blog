<p>I still have backups on other places but none of them are primary, that is, they can be deleted without any reason, and without carefully being watched.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Got another new project yesterday, I will have to improve the performance of registration letter, which has pretty high failure rate on gmail. Actually gmail has less than 10% market share but what I was told is that all gmail users are sort of ‚Äúopinion leader‚Äù, which means they actively blogging, or as a journalist, or whatever.</p>
<p>gmail believes they are cool, they don‚Äôt follow most of the conventions in this mail industry. However, since they take themselves as a hi-tech company, I‚Äôm going to solve this problem in hi-tech way.</p>
<p>Or, maybe I‚Äôm wrong ‚Äì to beat hi-tech companies, you always need to use low-tech skills <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
