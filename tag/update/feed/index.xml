										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just found that last post was back to Aug 15, which was 40 days ago (or more), guess I need to post something.</p>
<p>There is not much to update though, good thing is that two guys pinged me the other day, asking why I&#8217;m no longer update my blog, also mentioned that it&#8217;s really impressive that I was working on so many different stuffs.</p>
<p>Another update is that I have $1.81 on my AdSense account now, if you believe my articles do help, please click ads on the page. My target is to get $10 AdSense income within a year, so please help me.<span id="more-1404"></span></p>
<p>Other than these &#8230; I was pretty busy on a company&#8217;s project, which is fun in term of business but no that fun (to me) in term of technology. There are some interesting parts in the project, but I&#8217;m not working on them, instead, I&#8217;m working on PHP codes now, doing something that I believe most open source ORM had done pretty well. Yea you got it, I&#8217;m packaging all DB and other storage access codes so that frond end guys don&#8217;t have to know details, thus in the future if there is anything wrong, such as performance problem we can re-implement the backend.</p>
<p>I just cannot believe I&#8217;ve wrote thousands of junk codes and luckily, majority part passed all unit tests start from just now:</p>
