					<description><![CDATA[It seems they finished construction work on I680, though partly &#8211; the highway between Washington and Mission Blvd., it becomes 5 lanes now. It seems Californian still has money to build I680, the construction work didn&#8217;t get any impact from this economy crisis, good to know. I wish things can be better day by day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is absolutely true as I just saw it &#8211; there is a chicken in the middle of highway 680, around Automall blvd &#8230; ALIVE. Obviously this is the reason all cars was driving super slow at that point, the chicken was just sit there, calmly (at least I think it&#8217;s calm, or totally scared). <a href='https://xiehang.com/blog/2009/06/09/chicken-on-the-highway/' class='excerpt-more'>[...]</a>]]></description>
