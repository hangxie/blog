										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I accidentally changed some configuration of a VM and it refused to start after reboot, I know I can simply revert what I changed to make it works again so to avoid recovery process, and I found <a href="http://alexeytorkhov.blogspot.com/2009/09/mounting-raw-and-qcow2-vm-disk-images.html">this great article</a> which described exactly what I want. I&#8217;m going to repeat the steps here as I also need to write steps to unmount. Note that you need to have kpartx installed.<span id="more-1667"></span></p>
<p>Most VMs are in volume group, so here are steps to mount the VM image:<br />
[shell]<br />
sudo losetup /dev/loop0 /home/VM/vm1/disk.img<br />
sudo kpartx -a /dev/loop0<br />
sudo vgscan<br />
sudo vgchange -ay<br />
sudo vgscan<br />
# figure out name of the volume group by comparing output of two vgscan<br />
sudo mount /dev/vg_name/lv_root /mnt<br />
# now you can go to /mnt/etc to edit those configurations, then<br />
sudo umount /mnt<br />
sudo vgchange -an vg_name<br />
sudo kpartx -d /dev/loop0<br />
sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0<br />
[/shell]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally I decide to turn on console on all my VMs so that I don&#8217;t have to rely on VNC for remote access whenever network is having problem &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to join corp network now and there are lots of network glitches during last week and I believe there will still be some in the coming week.</p>
<p>Actually it&#8217;s not that complicated, on CentOS (5 or 6) machines, add following line to /etc/inittab (do a dmesg | grep tty to make sure it is ttyS0 for you, but I believe they are all the same for kvm based VMs):<span id="more-1609"></span><br />
<code># for console<br />
T0:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -h -L ttyS0 38400 vt100<br />
</code></p>
<p>then in /boot/grub/grub.conf:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comment out this line:<br />
<code>splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz</code></li>
<li>Add following lines after &#8220;hiddenmenu&#8221;, again make sure you are using the right tty device:<br />
<code>serial --unit=0 --speed=38400 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1<br />
terminal --timeout=10 serial console<br />
</code></li>
<li>Append these to each line start with &#8220;kernel /vmlinux&#8230;&#8221;:<br />
<code>console=tty0 console=ttyS0,38400n8</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Reboot the machine, and attach to to console by &#8220;virsh console &#8220;, then you will get console for both book progress and normal login.</p>
<p>On Ubuntu 10.04 or 12.04 (these are two versions I&#8217;m currently using), create /etc/init/ttyS0.conf:<br />
<code># ttyS0 - getty<br />
#<br />
# This service maintains a getty on ttyS0 from the point the system is<br />
# started until it is shut down again.</p>
<p>start on stopped rc or RUNLEVEL=[12345]<br />
stop on runlevel [!12345]</p>
<p>respawn<br />
exec /sbin/getty -L 115200 ttyS0 vt102</code></p>
<p>Then edit /etc/default/grub, change or add following lines:<br />
<code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8"<br />
GRUB_TERMINAL=serial<br />
GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial --speed=115200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1"<br />
</code></p>
<p>then &#8220;update-grub&#8221; to make it into real /boot/grub/grub.cfg (you can verify those console lines after running the command), then reboot, everything should be there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was not much progress with performance test as mentioned <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2009/09/09/mysqlmemcached-vs-openldap/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I first did test with LDAP vs. memcached, then found there was not much difference between those two, which is suspicious, so I started running test to compare pure database and memcached solution, which ideally should show lot of difference, but I failed.</p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t figured out what was the real cause, it seems VM is not that good to do this kind of test &#8211; thinking of limited resource (CPU, mem, network, disk, etc), all VMs will compete each other. Again, this is my guess and I will try to see what would be the best solution to get performance done in VM environment.</p>
<p>Even if I failed, it shows that VM will not be good for performance testing, nice try <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
