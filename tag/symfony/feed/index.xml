										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though problems I&#8217;m going to discuss are for symfony 1.2, I guess it applicable to 1.0 and 1.1 as well.</p>
<p>I finally got symfony works on godaddy shared hosting, I guess if I were running any sort of dedicated hosting, these problem could not have happened, as I have full control.</p>
<p>The first problem hit me is PHP version, symfony needs PHP5, and godaddy supports PHP5 &#8211; good. However, it seems godaddy&#8217;s default PHP is still PHP4 so have to set alias to make sure symfony script is interpreted by PHP5 instead of PHP4:</p>
<blockquote><p>alias symfony=&#8217;/usr/local/php5/bin/php /path/to/symfony-1.2.7/data/bin/symfony&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>after this, I got the problem, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>/usr/local/php5/bin/php: Symbol `client_errors&#8217; has different size in shared object, consider re-linking</p></blockquote>
<p>and turned out it was because of mysql client lib problem &#8211; I don&#8217;t know the detail yet, but seems /usr/local/php5/bin/php and /web/cgi-bin/php5 are both linked to /usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so.15, which works for /web one but not the /usr one. I did some tests and found /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.so.14.0.0 works perfect with /usr/local/php5/bin/php, so put this into my .bash_profile:</p>
<blockquote><p>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmysqlclient.so.14.0.0</p></blockquote>
<p>note that /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.so.10.0.0 doesn&#8217;t work well as it&#8217;s too old to support modern (new) password encrypt/authentication.</p>
<p>By now I can use symfony do the development job, but problem are still there while I&#8217;m trying to browse from browser, the first thing is rewrite rules &#8211; these lines should be uncommented from web/.htaccess:</p>
<blockquote><p>RewriteBase /<br />
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \..+$<br />
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$<br />
RewriteRule .* &#8211; [L]</p></blockquote>
<p>then I met the problem (which took me longest time to solve) with error:<br />
Empty module and/or action after parsing the URL &#8220;/index.php&#8221; (/).<br />
actually I should have got it solve earlier if I search on the web, there is <a href="http://www.codemassacre.com/2009/03/17/problems-hosting-symfony-12-sites-on-godaddy/">a great article talking about the solution</a>, and my problem got solved just after 1st part of solution mentioned by the blog &#8211; adding following lines to &#8220;all&#8221; section of apps/frontend/config/factories.yml:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>request:
  param:
    path_info_key: REQUEST_URI</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>be careful with intending, original blog seems not doing the right thing and put &#8220;request&#8221; and &#8220;param&#8221; in same level, which is wrong.</p>
<p>Alright, by this time you will be able to play with symfony on shared hosting with godaddy. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m using symfony 1.2 now and it can work with both Doctrine and Propel. Frankly speaking, I don&#8217;t have any ideas of which one is better, but thinking of Doctrine was added in 1.2 while Propel was there since 1.0, I would assume Doctrine is better (otherwise, why bother?).
