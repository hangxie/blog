<p>It seems EC2&#8217;s storage, at least EBS performs quite bad, I don&#8217;t have comparison in number, but for the follow-ups jobs, which are nothing to do with network, EC2 is hundreds or thousands times slower than a regular modern machine.</p>
<p>I guess traditional applications on EC2 don&#8217;t rely on EBS too much &#8211; most data write to S3/RDS/SDB, etc. However, I do have to pay more attention on this as there is a friend gets to run some critical jobs and I recommended EC2 &#8230; I will do some more tests and post result here if I find anything signaficant.</p>
