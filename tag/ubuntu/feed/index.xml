										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu 22.04 was <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-22-04-lts-released">just released</a>, I managed to upgrade my WordPress site (running on VM and only <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2022/03/04/move-to-static-site/">publish static site</a>), it was not as smooth as I thought, there were quite some small problems here and there, but eventually it worked after like 4 hours of troubleshooting, and so on.</p>
<p>As a side note, I no longer running Parallels since I found it tricked me to subscription which involves $79.99 per year, luckily I noticed the weird charge on my credit card so was able to cancel it the same day. I&#8217;m running my VM on <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> now, I didn&#8217;t notice performance difference between UTM and Parallels, though Parallels does provide more convenient features like desktop integration, snapshot, etc.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve been running Ubuntu since 10.04, but I&#8217;m seriously thinking of moving away from it now due to snap, there are more and more applications over Ubuntu dropped deb support and are solely on snap only, I don&#8217;t mind a distro changes its package management tool like yum to dnf, but I just don&#8217;t want to have 2 package management mechanism at the same time.</p>
<p>I may not run Fedora as I need LTS, I cannot choose Rocky as it (actually RHEL) lacks of aarch64 support. Most likely I&#8217;m going to play with Debian or Arch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several issues found after upgrade various version of Ubuntu to latest 14.04 LTS, luckily things are not that hard to fix.</p>
<p>ejabberd does not work, turned to be ejabberd was trying to get rid of asn1, and there were some problem caused by that. Though ejabberd fixed the problem right away, it seems Ubuntu took the wrong version. What you should do is upgrade ejabberd from 2.1.11 to 2.1.12 (later version may work as well, but I didn&#8217;t try), <span id="more-1691"></span></p>
<p>and if you don&#8217;t know how to play with erl => beam compilation like me, you can just setup a Fedora VM and install ejabberd over there and copy eldap.beam from ejabberd package (NOTE: not the eldap.beam from ejabberd-eldap package) to the Ubuntu box.</p>
<p>RoundCube web mail does not work, it was cause by several issues. First, apach2 now only takes *.conf from site-enabled/ directory instead of former configuration of taking anything (I could have wrong impression on old release, but this is the cause). Second, dovecot&#8217;s configuration needs some tweak &#8211; you just need add a new section to 10-mail.conf with namespace inbox defined, which has inbox = yes inside. The last thing is, you need to enable mcrypt.ini in PHP&#8217;s apache configuration, you can do whatever you want, I just symlink mcrypy.ini from mods-available/ to apache/ and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>The new RoundCube interface looks good, I&#8217;m going to dig around to see if there is any other theme with different color, I always prefer light-blue/light-gray style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2014/01/27/virtualization-glusterfs-and-automation/">This article</a> discussed how to install CentOS VM automatically with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstart_(Linux)">kickstart</a>. I tried to do similar thing for Ubuntu as well but failed so many times. It seems kickstart works with RedHat families pretty well which makes perfect sense, while Ubuntu does not like that way too much.<span id="more-1676"></span></p>
<p>So I turned to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preseed">preseed</a>, which was from Debian but works for its derivatives as well. After dig around here comes the preseed file:<br />
[raw]<br />
## Options to set on the command line<br />
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US<br />
d-i console-setup/ask_detect boolean false<br />

<p>d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true<br />
d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true<br />
d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note<br />
[/raw]</p>
<p>and launch the installation by:<br />
[shell]<br />
sudo virt-install &#8211;name ubuntu-test \<br />
  &#8211;ram 1024 &#8211;vcpus 1 \<br />
  &#8211;disk path=/tmp/test.img,size=20 \<br />
  &#8211;bridge=br2 \<br />
  &#8211;os-variant rhel6 &#8211;accelerate \<br />
  &#8211;location http://mirror.facebook.net/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/installer-amd64 \<br />

     console=ttyS0<br />
     locale=en_US<br />
     console-keymaps-at/keymap=us<br />
     console-setup/ask_detect=false<br />
     console-setup/layoutcode=us<br />
     keyboard-configuration/layout=USA<br />
     keyboard-configuration/variant=USA<br />
     hostname=some-special-name<br />
     domain=your.domain<br />
     &#8221;<br />
[/shell]</p>
<p>After the unattended installation finished, you will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) from facebook.net mirror</li>
<li>whole disk partitioned in to / and swap</li>
<li>root is the only user to allowed to login with encrypted password</li>
<li>host name set to some-special-name if DHCP does not provide valid one</li>
</ul>
<p>To make things better, you can configure your DHCP server to have MAC address map to some good name and IP address, then add &#8220;&#8211;mac=52:54:00:xx:xx:xx&#8221; to virt-install command line, the host name and domain from the DHCP server will have higher priority.</p>
<p>Play with it, you will like it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Give up MacBook Pro to someone else, and moved back to PC laptop.</p>
<p>I was thinking of running Ubuntu on the new laptop so to fully utilize the 16G memory and 4-core i7 processor. However, after two days&#8217; painful trial, I finally gave up and moved back to Windows, and you can image &#8211; I moved back to Windows 7 instead of 8.</p>
<p>The problem with Ubuntu and Windows 8 are similar, they were not designed by following people&#8217;s common sense, or direct sense, whatever you want to name it. I, personally, believe the usability is OSX &gt; Windows 7 (Windows XP as well) &gt; Ubuntu (Windows Vista is almost the same) &gt; Windows 8.</p>
<p>Heard of Windows 8 is to be upgraded to have something like start button and program folders, etc. though it is still rumor so far. Shall we just name these changes as &#8220;graceful downgrade&#8221; in case they are really true? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>BTW, I turned on Hyper-Thread on i7 processor so logically, I&#8217;m running a 8-core machine with 16G memory &#8211; this is my dreaming machine several years ago <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally I found this <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Debian-Binary-Package-Building-HOWTO/">Debian Binary Package Building HOWTO</a>.</p>
<p>Actually I&#8217;ve been searching online for sometime, however, most search results lead me to Ubuntu or Debian Wiki which are totally useless, thinking of they are using lots of (and different) tools plus need user interact with it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the how-to page mentioned above did a clear step-by-step turtorial, without any fancy tools. Surely you still need dpkg package and lintian.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also learning how to write a good how-to like this one, it seems learn by sample is always easier.</p>
<p>I guess now I understand why I don&#8217;t want to go to school again.</p>
