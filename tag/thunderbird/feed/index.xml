										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems 3.0.3 is a good version, at least to me.</p>
<p>I think I was one of the first batch that tried out TB3, however, it seems my mailbox does not fit into TB3 &#8211; I have ~600 mail folders, with ~110K mails and the biggest folder has about 8000 mails. Obvious old version of TB3 cannot handle this &#8211; it popped up error message window from time to time and every time I started TB3 I have to wait for pretty long time to get everything sync&#8217;ed.</p>
<p>Thanks 3.0.3, it works now.</p>
<p>As a side note, corporate IT seems force me upgrade to TB3 for whatever reason I don&#8217;t know, so I put a shortcut on my desktop to downgrade to TB2 &#8211; I believe I&#8217;ve run this &#8220;downgrade&#8221; close to 50 times in the past 3 months, luckily I no longer need to do it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t want to say it&#8217;s good, as I feel performance is not that great compare with the old version. However, the look-n-feel is neat, makes it a cute product and makes me thinking &#8211; the old version is too &#8220;formal&#8221;.</p>
<p>It seems in now a day, people care UI more than functionality, if I had the choice I would not upgrade to the new version so that I can keep my productivity, but it&#8217;s a pity it was set to upgrade automatically (I made the setting? not sure).</p>
<p>Will (have to) keep using it till I get familiar, anyway I don&#8217;t have any other alternative, yet, or maybe it&#8217;s the time to look for alternative.</p>
