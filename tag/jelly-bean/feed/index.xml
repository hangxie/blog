										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was just for fun, and this would be a good exercise for potential migrating my AT&amp;T phone to some other images &#8211; I need hotspot feature but it&#8217;s a premium feature from AT&amp;T &#8230;</p>
<p>Back to Kindle Fire, the process was pretty simple &#8211; root it, flash with new root image and gapp, that&#8217;s it. However, after that it seems some Apps are not that stable, crash or slow respond from time to time, though some other Apps run smoothly. I&#8217;m not sure so far if it is problem from Apps (i.e. compatibility issue with Jelly Bean), or it is Jelly Bean I was using is having problem with Kindle Fire (incompatible or poor hardware). I will play with them for a while and post here if I see anything interesting.</p>
