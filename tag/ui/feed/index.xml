										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Give up MacBook Pro to someone else, and moved back to PC laptop.</p>
<p>I was thinking of running Ubuntu on the new laptop so to fully utilize the 16G memory and 4-core i7 processor. However, after two days&#8217; painful trial, I finally gave up and moved back to Windows, and you can image &#8211; I moved back to Windows 7 instead of 8.</p>
<p>The problem with Ubuntu and Windows 8 are similar, they were not designed by following people&#8217;s common sense, or direct sense, whatever you want to name it. I, personally, believe the usability is OSX &gt; Windows 7 (Windows XP as well) &gt; Ubuntu (Windows Vista is almost the same) &gt; Windows 8.</p>
<p>Heard of Windows 8 is to be upgraded to have something like start button and program folders, etc. though it is still rumor so far. Shall we just name these changes as &#8220;graceful downgrade&#8221; in case they are really true? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>BTW, I turned on Hyper-Thread on i7 processor so logically, I&#8217;m running a 8-core machine with 16G memory &#8211; this is my dreaming machine several years ago <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I seldom like new UI of product I use, the extreme example is I HATE the new gmail UI whenever it was launched more than a year ago &#8211; it took me quite some time to figure out where is addressbook and where I can manage my domain.</p>
<p>However, Yahoo Mail&#8217;s new UI is definitely better than previous version, light, clean, and most things are still there &#8211; either it did not change, or it can be easily located.</p>
<p>Well done, Yahoo.</p>
