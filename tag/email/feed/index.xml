										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somebody (stupidly?) registered a Facebook account with my Hotmail E-Mail address and no matter whose fault it is, it became a live account without verifying the E-Mail address, and I started getting all sort of social event notifications.</p>
<p>So I went to Facebook and do a password retrieval through the E-Mail address, I cannot believe that even a unverified E-Mail address can be used as password recovery, so at last I successfully take over the account and shut it down.</p>
<p>I guess someone is crying now but if I didn&#8217;t do that I will be the one crying in the corner, I believe this is Facebook&#8217;s fault.</p>

<p>BTW, I think I need to tweet now, it is not a good idea to make my blog too short &#8211; kind of unprofessional <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are upgrading corporate E-Mail system now &#8211; it&#8217;s our first production E-Mail system :).</p>
<p>It seems there are way too many things to be tested, people are working really hard on that but it still took quite some time.</p>
<p>Now everything had been switched to the new system and we (alright, exclude myself) are busy verifying the system. It takes time, and I&#8217;m sleepy here &#8230;</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I&#8217;ll pay more attention on public E-Mail system, but I know corporate E-Mail system will kill us sooner or later based on my previous experience.</p>
