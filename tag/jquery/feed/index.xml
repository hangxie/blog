										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was working on a simple feature to grab some innerText of HTML tags in a web page, and need to get that done in front end, i.e. JavaScript. The basic feature took me no more than 5 minutes to finish, but after I turned from Chrome to Firefox, I knew I&#8217;m in big trouble.</p>
<p>Browser compatibility, which seems still a nightmare in now a world even Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Safari are all announcing following some sorts of rules, and obviously learning those rules seems to be tough.</p>
<p>So I turned to jQuery (and actually tried YUI as well) and it seems pretty cool, everything works smoothly even on my mobile phone. Although the feature is not that fancy so it may haven&#8217;t hit the brick yet, but definitely this is a good sign to me.</p>
<p>A friend of mine told me that their dev team is moving from native Apps to HTML5 for quick prototype and to avoid troublesome incompatibility problem, is that what I should do?</p>
