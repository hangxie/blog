										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s time to go back work, National Day long holiday is ending.</p>
<p>At least I had some good sleep during the long holiday, also get some sort of &#8220;inner peace&#8221; after having the good sleep :). It seems labor work (most of them are yard work) helps a lot to get me good sleep, I will see if I can get some labor work or body exercise whenever I get back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>It will be a tough month to me as I need to finish some hard steps to re-org the team, some stuffs had been done and it seems really hurt, but like it or not, I need to get rest done in a week or two, and make everyone in the team to focus on new business.</p>
<p>To myself actually this is a good opportunity to practice those skills though I had tried before, painful learning curve.</p>
