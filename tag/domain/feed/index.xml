										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NetworkManager should be 2nd most useless thing on Linux (I give champaignship to SELinux).</p>
<p>Again this is NIS client setup, after everything setup, I found that the domain is messed up, obviously NetworkManager set domain to localdomain for some reason, it could be because of its default setting, but isnt&#8217;t good to leave this default value as a comment in configuration file? Anyway, I spent quite sometime digging into ypbind, nss, network, dhcp, stuffs, and finally &#8211; just disable the NetworkManager service, reboot the machine and everything went perfectly fine.</p>
<p>So write this down here &#8211; remind me disable NetworkManager next time if I install any Linux box.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It used to be one of the most reliable and cute (or cool?) service on the Web, but seems not any more.</p>
<p>I tried to move two of my sites to Google App, but had to give up because all sorts of troubles it gave to me. Yesterday I was able to move one site to it, but at the last step (to activate my E-Mail account, I guess), it kept telling my my Google account was webmaster@gmail.com and I cannot change it. I tried to move to webmaster@mydomain.com but failed due to it had been registered, and if I want to hook up with this existing account it told me that I need to use webmaster@gmail.com. I was totally lost of what I should do, so I simply removed my domain from it.</p>
<p>It seems Google needs sometime to finish the work of removing my site as I no longer can register it, so I tried another domain I own, which is currently running on some other service providers (free, as well). Now Google is doing much better &#8230; I mentioned much better because it simply give me &#8220;Server error&#8221; (I guess it is HTTP 5xx but I&#8217;m not sure), so I don&#8217;t have to go through all the registration process and stuck in some middle way, hehe.</p>
<p>So, good-bye to Google App, for now, I will come back and check things out later on, maybe weeks, maybe months.</p>
<p>BTW, it could be Google is not willing to provide free service any more, so Google&#8217;s technical team should not be blamed, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Could be another blog and some testing &#8211; after I started doing this English blogging, I found that less Chinese came to read. There are still some good technology that I want to discuss in Chinese, or let&#8217;s say, get them to be known in China, so running a Chinese blog could be a good idea.</p>
<p>Anything else than that does not make too much sense at this moment. Godaddy&#8217;s Python is still at 2.4, I don&#8217;t think I can play with Python there, and I don&#8217;t have any other hosting plan yet, maybe I should shop around.</p>

<p>Actually I believe Microsoft was wasting money &#8211; I register a domain a while back but never used it, at all.</p>
