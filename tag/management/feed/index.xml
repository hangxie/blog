<p>One guy from US came to visit Shanghai so we had dinner together, during the dinner I found 4 people there are: myself, my ex-boss who&#8217;s working for Microsoft now, my ex-boss&#8217; boss (the visitor, and will move to Microsoft in September), and my ex-boss&#8217; boss&#8217; boss (that&#8217;s my boss now).</p>
<p>Glad to see I got upraded &#8211; my current boss was my boss&#8217; boss in my last project, and he was my boss&#8217; boss&#8217; boss in the my project prior to that. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New policy is coming out regarding the performance management, that is, manager will review performance (and maybe setup goal as well) with employees in a quarterly basis. It is an important enhancement, definitely, which can help people understand how he/she was doing and what&#8217;s the expectation from management, and this is the enhancement that we tried couple of times in the past ~10 years &#8230;</p>
<p>So every time people started complaining about goals are unclear, or feedback is not timely, the company triggered this kind of &#8220;enhancement&#8221; but soon people (may be another group of people) started complaining that there are too many paperwork or B.S. meeting and that&#8217;s annoying, then, you know it, right? Company would move back to annually review.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how long it can last this time. I would to say this is a bad idea since it just adds more paperwork to good managers who keep good communication with their team members, and it doesn&#8217;t help those managers who don&#8217;t share their idea with their teams. Management, especially people management is not something that can be &#8220;formalized&#8221;, i.e. make it formal policy/process, it is more about basic human interact.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s my understanding, and I could be wrong.</p>
