										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I setup a mail server and an IM server, again &#8230; just for whatever reason. It&#8217;s fun though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still with openldap, postfix, mysql, ejabberd, but use dovecot replaces courier for imap, amavisd integrated with spamassassin and clamav to replace previous spamassassin-only system, and roundcube replaces squirrelmail. Things are more or less easier to setup.</p>
<p>There are two things left, one is that need to direct spams to spam folder, this was done by maildrop but since I&#8217;m away from courier, procmail may be a more reasonable choice but still need to evaluate. The other thing is that I want to send all incoming and outgoing mails to some other gmail accounts so that I can keep a copy of everything, but I haven&#8217;t decided what&#8217;s the better approach for this. Also, if it is possible to get XMPP messages backup somewhere, that will be great.</p>
<p>I was thinking of building up a search feature for this mail system, I haven&#8217;t got exact design done yet, but some features are in my mind: close to realtime (tens of seconds latency), attachment friendly (dig into attachments to find context), and scriptable, i.e. core engine can be (or have to be) C/C++, but lots of external stuffs should be able to be done in PHP/Perl, etc.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see.</p>
