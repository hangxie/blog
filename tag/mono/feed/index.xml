										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s Lunar New Year in China so not much to do recently, so I could have spent some time on digging into development stuffs to see what to play in the coming months.</p>
<p>I upgraded my Windows VM from XP to 7 so that I can install full set of Visual Studio Express tools thus I can develop Windows Phone 7 applications, at the same time, I moved back to Eclipse from NetBeans for Android. Also, I did some research (little to none, though), found <a href="http://monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a> seems like a pretty promising tool though plugins for mobile platforms are not free.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have enough time to do serious development &#8230; Client side software development is still a headache to me. I have to recall how I made the music player last time &#8211; it took me more than a year to did everything but at least I had a runnable version within a month, which is not that bad.</p>
<p>My current plan is build up a Amazon AWS console for all three major platforms (did I mention this before?), wish I can get things done in a month or two.</p>
<p>I just spend too much time on the way to the office, need to think about a solution. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
