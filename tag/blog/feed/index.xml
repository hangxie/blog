<p>It seems China Telecom blocked access to several the GoDaddy DNS servers, I don&#8217;t know the exact reason behind the scene, but obviously there were something &#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, good to see my site&#8217;s back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Got a new domain (transferred from previous Windows Live free domain registry), but not sure what I&#8217;m going to do with it.</p>
<p>Could be another blog and some testing &#8211; after I started doing this English blogging, I found that less Chinese came to read. There are still some good technology that I want to discuss in Chinese, or let&#8217;s say, get them to be known in China, so running a Chinese blog could be a good idea.</p>
<p>Anything else than that does not make too much sense at this moment. Godaddy&#8217;s Python is still at 2.4, I don&#8217;t think I can play with Python there, and I don&#8217;t have any other hosting plan yet, maybe I should shop around.</p>
