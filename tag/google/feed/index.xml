										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several things happened in the past a couple years so I moved this blog site to static, some major issues lead to this change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google is no longer my preferred service provider, so I&#8217;m moving away from AdSense and Analytics</li>
<li>I&#8217;m no longer actively writing so I don&#8217;t expect people interact with me through this site</li>
<li>Google is going to stop G Suite legacy so I assume they will stop GCE free tier soon, which I&#8217;m running this site at</li>
</ul>
<p>For now I have an VM running Ubuntu with WordPress installed, I launch the VM whenever I want to write something, then using <a href="https://www.simplystatic.co/">Simply Static</a> to generate pure static pages then copy to an Nginx server. The Nginx is still running on GCE but since everything&#8217;s static, I can easily port it to anywhere cheap whenever needed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve disabled most dynamic features during this process, like search, comment, AdSense, Analytics, etc. There may be some features that are currently broken, I will fix them whenever I know.</p>

I changed to another AdSense plugin but it&#8217;s still the same. I don&#8217;t think Google&#8217;s service is having problem, especially for this long, so it could be either my account is having problem, or Google knows it&#8217;s me so refuse to show me ads, or my IP is blacklisted (both office and home? cannot be &#8230;).</p>
<p>Anyway, will keep watching this for some time but it&#8217;s definitely not urgent and important &#8230; I think all I&#8217;ve got from Google for more than a year is less than $10, sure, it&#8217;s not Google&#8217;s problem, it&#8217;s me not getting the site popular :D.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/03/google-dns-opendns/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&amp;utm_content=My+Yahoo">post about Google DNS service</a>, it seems it&#8217;s breaking the eco system in silicon valley.</p>
<p>I used to believe silicon valley has good eco system for start-ups, that is, start-up companies try all sort of new ideas, and once proved working, they can go IPO or get acquired by a big company, so investors can get return, as well as founders get financial benifit.</p>
<p>Story is different in China, small companies try all new ideas, and once proved working, big companies become copycat, using their massive audience base kill the start-ups.</p>
<p>Pity I&#8217;m seeing Google is following the second route now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend mentioned to me Google is hiring and lots of Yahoo!s are jumping off the sinking ship and heading to google, so I should try.</p>
<p>Well, maybe &#8230; but no, there are some difficulties I need to overcome before I can be google:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can hardly believe I can pass any interviews there, thinking of they like talking about algorithms so much.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m less confident on my educational background, all that I heard of is they prefer master/PhD from famous universities and I have nothing to do with these two</li>
<li>I believe their culture is for youth, who can live in campus for days or weeks without leaving, while I want to have my family life</li>
<li>I will be absolutely abnormal if I still don&#8217;t have lunch even if the company provides free lunch</li>
</ul>
<p>So the conclusion is that I will stay here for some time, even I move on in the future, google can hardly be my destination.</p>
<p>Pity to google &#8211; I have some friends in China are really good in this area, but none of them works for google, could be because of any reasons above <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boss asked me check out Google&#8217;s App Engine, and said that&#8217;s cool and could be the direction that we are going to move to, though we may only serve internal customers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still playing with it &#8211; I&#8217;m not familiar with Python no Java, and I don&#8217;t like them too much, but I can try.</p>
<p>Is grid/cloud the right thing to go? Doubt, but since there are so many experts take it seriously as future, let&#8217;s assume it is the direction. It may like &#8220;open system&#8221;, or &#8220;client servr&#8221;, or &#8220;3-tiers achitect&#8221;, or &#8220;go web&#8221;, or &#8220;virtualization&#8221; &#8211; all these words used to be fancy or cool, but later on they just become our daily life in development. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
