										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believed the old video card from the HP desktop I purchased last year has no use at all so I threw it away about a week back just after I came back from vacation, but obviously I did something wrong.</p>
<p>Today I got a mail from HP saying that I can get that one replaced, pity I don&#8217;t have it any more, and have to mention &#8211; I did this while I kept telling myself &#8220;be patient&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unlucky again, but I will be more patient in the future to make sure I won&#8217;t make similar mistakes again, in other more important pieces of my life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was in Beijing I installed <a href="http://www.logmein.com/">logmein</a> on my mother&#8217;s desktop, and obviously this is a smart move.</p>
<p>Yesterday she got some problem with her computer (missing the shortcut to the camera folder), usually, it would take me quite a while talking to her to know what&#8217;s happening there and then spend half an hour or even more to get her understand what should be done to get things fixed.</p>
<p>Now, it becomes super easy &#8211; she knows how to enable logmein, and once she did that, I can get to her machine to check around and fix it right away (you know how easy it is, right?), and at the same time she can see what I have done to her machine so just in case she wants to learn some, she can ask questions and I can answer them right away.</p>
<p>This is a nice product, a great free service, I know big companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Cisco are all having similar products, just wish logmein can survive in the competition so that we can keep using it.</p>
<p>BTW, it supports Windows and Mac,both are running well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m moving my main working environment at home from company&#8217;s laptop to personal desktop, I wish this can help me away from work for enough time while staying at home, as life is not just working for the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s done already &#8211; everything got set up almost exactly the same as the laptop, except some IM accounts (I have too many IM accounts, I know, but 90% of them are for email only :D). Also, I&#8217;ve removed some personal development environments from the laptop, include Blackberry&#8217;s BDE, and Microsoft&#8217;s Visual C++ Express, I&#8217;ll remove GNAT GPS and Windows SDK from it after I finish code clean up over my laptop, sure I will not need Tortoise SVN to check in code after that, then company-issued laptop will just for company.</p>
