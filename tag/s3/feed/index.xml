<p>I still have backups on other places but none of them are primary, that is, they can be deleted without any reason, and without carefully being watched.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The AWS App on iOS is pretty much done, at least I have made readonly part of S3 and EC2 works, and I don&#8217;t think write operations (create, update, delete, etc) are feasible to mobile phones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m moving to Windows Phone now, trying to build up similar App in term of functionality &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if I can build things with similar UI since different app store may have totally different tastes/rules on UI standard, better follow what they asked for.</p>
<p>I wish Windows Phone development will be easier thinking of I&#8217;ve done .Net/Visual Studio development before, let&#8217;s see &#8211; I give myself 2 weeks, and will spend no more than an hour per day.</p>
<p>Actually I tried both Android and Windows Phone the other day, trying to get basic idea of development. Obviously I don&#8217;t like Android, either because of I&#8217;m not a Java fan, or because of ugly interface of Eclipse &#8211; it may only be that ugly on OSX though, but I don&#8217;t have space (read: memory) to launch such a fat IDE in my Windows VM so leave it to the last.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This may not be useful to others, but it bothered me quite some time, so I&#8217;d like to write it down in case some others stuck at the same place as I did.</p>
<p>getMetadataForKey calls from aws-ios-sdk, actually it:</p>
<ol>
<li>returns user defined meta data, nothing to do with s3&#8217;s meta data</li>
<li>the key used here will be prepended a &#8220;x-aws-meta-&#8220;, that is, in aws console, we will see a meta data entry keyed with &#8220;x-aws-meta-hahaha&#8221;, but in ios app you need to use &#8220;hahaha&#8221; to get the value</li>
</ol>
<p>some other interesting stuffs &#8230; don&#8217;t use S3GetObjectRequest/Response call to get object&#8217;s header information, as it will indeed download the object. Instead, you should use S3GetObjectMetadataRequest/Response.</p>
<p>To get &#8220;Expiry Date&#8221; and  &#8220;Lifecycle Rule&#8221; information as they are shown on aws console, you need to use response&#8221;s valueForHTTPHeaderField method with key &#8220;x-amz-expiration&#8221;, the parse it &#8230; I guess there should be something more easier but havenn&#8217;t figured out how. Both &#8220;expiry-date&#8221; and &#8220;rule-id&#8221; are there so you can use them, note that they can be empty so better prepare for that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in the middle of moving some stuffs to Amazon AWS, and the first project is moving back up of my friend&#8217;s web site to Amazon as it gets no online access and data volume is not that big. The test seems good so far with my (first year) free AWS S3, I will stop current backup plan which sending data to my personal server in a week or two.</p>
<p>Amazon did great job to ease usage of AWS at least for S3, and based on my limited experience on EC2 it is not that hard to deploy but I still need to figure out how difficult it is to deploy multiple instances in a programable way as this will be the most reasonable way to get things done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">AWS Free Usage Tier</a>, good way to evaluate how much I&#8217;m going to spend in a serious project.</p>
