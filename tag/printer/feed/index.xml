										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mom&#8217;s computer is too old to be &#8220;cured&#8221; &#8211; I didn&#8217;t check through but I believe it is running a Pentium 4 at frequency 1.x Ghz, and it has 192M or 256M memory. Mom told me couple of times that if I want to do anything with the machine, I have to be patient.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m less patient :(. So I decided to get a new desktop for her. I went to an &#8220;electronic market&#8221; with RMB 5000 in my pocket, thinking of getting a desktop plus a printer.</p>
<p>Well, none of those branded reseller could sell me a machine without display/keyboard/mouse, so I went to a DIY shop, asking them build up a basic desktop for me. After discussing about the configuration (some AMD Sempron dual-core, 2G mem, 250G disk, a DVD-RW, all others are on the integrated motherboard), the guy told me it is RMB 1,600, about $230. People told me you have to bargain for the price there, but I didn&#8217;t that day :). The price was far below my expectation so I don&#8217;t mind they are going to get 100 or 200 more in profit.</p>
<p>Actually I was wondering how they can make money to support all the employees there &#8211; there is a seems-to-be-the-boss, with 2 boys sound like senior (they can make a configuration and can do the installation), plus 3 others seems to be intern or something (they were helping). It was said the cost of rental is couple of thousands a month, and I don&#8217;t think they are going to make more than 10 deals a day &#8211; and it was a weekend.</p>
<p>Whenever I went to printer it is another story &#8211; inkjet are roughly $70, while the ink will be $30, laser printer is about $300, while the toner is about $150. The business model is pretty clear here, that is, you get the printer for almost free (actually inkjet printer is free as it contains two ink boxes inside, right?) and get profit from ink/toner. I&#8217;m not sure if HP is the one invited this but obviously it&#8217;s a good deal.</p>
<p>BTW, I didn&#8217;t buy the printer as I don&#8217;t think my parents want to afford the cost.:)</p>
