										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agree social network is sort of virus, you were brought into the game just because one of your friends is there, and then later on you will find all of your friends are there.</p>
<p>This is what I found today &#8211; I registered my account a year back I guess (by the time I know kaixin001.com, and people mentioned it is just another facebook), and at that time there was not many friends playing there. When I checked again this morning, it seems 50% of my friends who regularly accesses internet has an account there.</p>
<p>Now the question is &#8211; how many of them use it daily or even weekly? This is so-called active user, but it seems to me pretty low, maybe 1/10. Well someone would say 10% is really a good number, but I believe social network should have higher active rate.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how long I can play with this one, facebook is way too fun compare with linkedin, I get rid of kaixin001.com as I found it is just a social network, means other than play some games, I got nothing else, actually it was even not the good place to keep contact with friends, let&#8217;s see how facebook works,</p>
