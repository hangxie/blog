										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working for the big chip company now, sound a little bit weird, though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m sitting in backend team focusing on DevOps, I guess I will be in this mixed role till we find a dedicated DevOps guy. I guess whenever that happens, I&#8217;ve already finished monitoring facility (plus logistical stuffs like on-call schedule, etc.), and should have finished the plan to migrate from Rackspace to AWS.</p>
<p>Everything works smoothly so far except git &#8211; I admit current company is using git in a modern way, but I don&#8217;t think previous company was doing something wrong. Anyway, I believe people do have different ideas of how to use git, I just have to fit into the company&#8217;s style.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite like saltstack although I&#8217;m still trying to get familiar with it. However, before I raise this as a concern to the team, I&#8217;d like to make sure everything that saltstack is doing can be done by cfengine.</p>
<p>Ah yea, also need to evaluate <a href="http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/">Shinken</a> as it&#8217;s a pure Python solution, and &#8220;we are a python house&#8221;.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it was in year 2005 or 2006 that I migrated everything from CVS to SVN, and it was the time that my company was doing that as well. Now I&#8217;m migrating to git, and of course, my current company is doing the same thing :P.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think it was in year 2005 or 2006 that I migrated everything from CVS to SVN, and it was the time that my company was doing that as well. Now I&#8217;m migrating to git, and of course, my current company is doing the same thing :P.</p>
<p>Guess everybody knows the reason &#8230; let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s offline support, that you don&#8217;t have to connect to sever to do commit. Further more, subversion does not work well on VirtualBox&#8217;s shared folder, while git has no problem at all, I guess people like me who needs to work on both *ix and Windows platforms have to have this kind of support.</p>
<p>And this is the time to see how many projects I have, WeirdBox is a great thing to keep thinking of I&#8217;ve play with the codes for several years, aws-browser is obviously another thing to keep thinking of it&#8217;s my first app on iOS and AWS (EC2 and S3), XMPP Mail Alert has to be migrated as I&#8217;m using it at this moment (for a friend&#8217;s web site). I cannot recall anything else but will post here if I find any.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m using github, because of feel like safe? At least it&#8217;s not that vulnerable as other small players.</p>
