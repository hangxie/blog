										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recalled it was a weird dinner last Friday &#8230;</p>
<p>One guy from US came to visit Shanghai so we had dinner together, during the dinner I found 4 people there are: myself, my ex-boss who&#8217;s working for Microsoft now, my ex-boss&#8217; boss (the visitor, and will move to Microsoft in September), and my ex-boss&#8217; boss&#8217; boss (that&#8217;s my boss now).</p>
<p>Glad to see I got upraded &#8211; my current boss was my boss&#8217; boss in my last project, and he was my boss&#8217; boss&#8217; boss in the my project prior to that. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
