										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life may be a circle, but I wish it is not a flat circle <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>I&#8217;m packing now, walking in the nearly empty apartment I found that it looks like whenever I just moved in 18 months ago. I cannot believe I moved in so many stuffs that after several times of flying back to Beijing with big suitcase, plus 4 pack of clothes, and 3 boxes of miscellaneous goodies, I still have enough to fill up two suitcase that will fly back to Beijing with me week after the next.</p>
<p>I wish my career life won&#8217;t be a circle either but seems to be some sort of true <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Good thing is that after acting as different management roles, I found out that I can deal with engineering and production jobs easier but not business positions, at all. However, 18 months experience gave me great confidence on dealing with brand new teams, while I was really not good at this in old days.</p>
<p>I wish my technical skills can be a circle <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . I&#8217;m playing with NetBeans to do Android development, while Xcode for OSX and iOS. There is not much progress so far but I do wish I can pick client side development as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Jumping between US and China, I think the most significant change is that I&#8217;m now feeling comfortable with travelling around, even to a strange place.</p>
<p>Too much to say &#8230; in two weeks I&#8217;m going back to US, wish everything will be fine and I&#8217;m going to planning for my next 10 years.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
