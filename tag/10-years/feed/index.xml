										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was downloading something (in my office) just now and found the speed was pretty fast, and this reminds me 10 years ago &#8230;</p>
<p>It was my first trip to headquarter, whenever I hook up my laptop and start downloading something (I think it was Messenger), it was &#8230; super fast.</p>
<p>I talked to my colleague and asked him what&#8217;s the bandwidth between office and outside internet, he was not sure and said could be Giga.</p>
<p>Man, GIGA!!! I think most Chinese Internet companies at that time are running 2X100M for IDC, and offices used to use 64K (DDN) or 128K (ISDN).</p>
<p>Things changed a lot in the past 10 years, and something will happen in 10th year :), stay tuned.</p>

It was my boss&#8217; boss &#8211; this morning he&#8217;s in the same elevator and said &#8220;congratulation&#8221;, this makes me feel better :), but whenever he asked me &#8220;how&#8217;s the feeling?&#8221; my answer is &#8220;way too long&#8221;.

I wish I can stay here as long as I can, but now I do doubt if I can stay here for another 10 years, let&#8217;s see. ðŸ™‚]]></description>
