										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu 22.04 was <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-22-04-lts-released">just released</a>, I managed to upgrade my WordPress site (running on VM and only <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2022/03/04/move-to-static-site/">publish static site</a>), it was not as smooth as I thought, there were quite some small problems here and there, but eventually it worked after like 4 hours of troubleshooting, and so on.</p>
<p>As a side note, I no longer running Parallels since I found it tricked me to subscription which involves $79.99 per year, luckily I noticed the weird charge on my credit card so was able to cancel it the same day. I&#8217;m running my VM on <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> now, I didn&#8217;t notice performance difference between UTM and Parallels, though Parallels does provide more convenient features like desktop integration, snapshot, etc.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve been running Ubuntu since 10.04, but I&#8217;m seriously thinking of moving away from it now due to snap, there are more and more applications over Ubuntu dropped deb support and are solely on snap only, I don&#8217;t mind a distro changes its package management tool like yum to dnf, but I just don&#8217;t want to have 2 package management mechanism at the same time.</p>
<p>I may not run Fedora as I need LTS, I cannot choose Rocky as it (actually RHEL) lacks of aarch64 support. Most likely I&#8217;m going to play with Debian or Arch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actually this should apply to all &#8220;non-standard&#8221; window managers on Fedora &#8211; let&#8217;s assume KDE and gnome (maybe twm as well) are all standard WM per Fedora.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been away from Fedora for some time &#8211; left by 16 and came back by 18, I have to say, Fedora is moving more and more closer to Windows and away from Unix. Why? Think about it changed from service/chkconfig to systemctl, the only advance to me is that someone who&#8217;s relying on service has to migrate do systemctl, and developers have to maintain all these, and why don&#8217;t you take iptables and use firewall instead? I didn&#8217;t see the logic behind that, except &#8211; it&#8217;s building lots of &#8220;new features&#8221; to add to so-called feature list or selling point.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s come back to xrdp. Although setup xrdp on Ubuntu is almost nothing, it takes me almost a day to get everything done on Fedora. Here are some hints:<span id="more-1527"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>remember do a &#8220;sudo firewall-cmd &#8211;add-port 3389/tcp &#8211;permanent so that &#8220;dynamically managed firewall&#8221; can allow network traffic goes through, sound familiar? Yea, more or less like the Windows firewall.</li>
<li>edit (most likely you need to create) /etc/sysconfig/desktop, with this line: PREFERRED=startxfce4, this tells X that xfce IS a windows manager &#8230;</li>
</ol>
<p>And here is related pages for these issues:</p>

<p>Personally I prefer an on site upgrade to make sure everything is up-to-date, but my friend may not like this as the rental (i.e. hosting) will be ended in less a year.</p>
<p>Anyway, waiting for reply now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I was trying to upgrade a friend&#8217;s Fedora machine from 10 to 11, I found that the yum got some problems with mirrorlist file, which had been addressed with Fedora/yum guys, but so there there is no fix, just a workaround.</p>
<p>Then yesterday WordPress prompted there is a new version can be upgraded to, so I did &#8230; everything went smoothly, automatic upgrade, so fancy, but after upgrade &#8211; hold on, all my posts became PHP error message.</p>
<p>Obviously the new 2.8 does not support old smiley well, or at least it changed requirement of the smileys&#8217; pattern. I haven&#8217;t found the root cause yet so I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the workaround so far, so I just simply disabled smiley and seems it works fine to me, so far.</p>
<p>I will post here later if I found anything.</p>
