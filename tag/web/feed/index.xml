										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems to me it&#8217;s my Java time again &#8211; several things are pushing to try out Java although the company is still moving forward to C/C++ and PHP.</p>
<p>First problem is Android, this is a platform that <strong>EVERY</strong> application needs to think about, and obviously Java is the only way to get things done (I heard of NDK, but it seems it is not a full function development kit).</p>
<p>The next one is migration, I&#8217;m seriously thinking about migrating all my Java Web sites to PHP so that we can leverage resources within the company, such as resource pool. I need to dig into some sample applications to see how much effort we need to get this done, but since Java developers won&#8217;t like this idea (although they know about it), I don&#8217;t expect they are going to give me reasonable evaluation, so I have to be hands-on.</p>
<p>Nothing else, I still don&#8217;t believe Java is a good choice for any applications other than e-commerce, and this makes me sick as it does sound like &#8220;COBOL is the excellent choice for business system&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, Java is heavy and fat, it does not fit into my world :).</p>
