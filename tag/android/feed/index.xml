										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was just for fun, and this would be a good exercise for potential migrating my AT&amp;T phone to some other images &#8211; I need hotspot feature but it&#8217;s a premium feature from AT&amp;T &#8230;</p>
<p>Back to Kindle Fire, the process was pretty simple &#8211; root it, flash with new root image and gapp, that&#8217;s it. However, after that it seems some Apps are not that stable, crash or slow respond from time to time, though some other Apps run smoothly. I&#8217;m not sure so far if it is problem from Apps (i.e. compatibility issue with Jelly Bean), or it is Jelly Bean I was using is having problem with Kindle Fire (incompatible or poor hardware). I will play with them for a while and post here if I see anything interesting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eclipse just ate too much CPU and memory resource (thanks Java), so I decided to move to <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html">command line android development</a>.</p>
<p>And again, I will keep a copy of steps here so that ease my future lookup:<span id="more-1458"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Preparation
<ul>
<li>Install android SDK, let&#8217;s assume you download and unzipped everything to /some/where/to/sdk, and added tools/ and platform-tools/ to PATH already</li>
<li>Downloaded necessary SDK by running &#8220;android sdk&#8221;</li>
<li>Created necessary virtual devices by running &#8220;android avd&#8221;</li>
<li>Generate your private key by running &#8220;keytool -J-Dfile.encoding=utf8 -genkey -v -keystore android.keystore -alias release -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000&#8221; under the sdk/ directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build
<ul>
<li>My project was generated by cordova, so I don&#8217;t have to create the project from scratch, but your situation may be different so play with it (android create project) by your own &#8230;</li>
<li>edit the ant.properties under project root directory, adding two lines like these<br />
key.store=/some/where/to/sdk/android.keystore<br />
key.alias=release</li>
<li>Above command will generate multiple *-release*.apk under bin/ directory, and the *-release.apk is what we are going to use for installation, assume it is something-release.apk, which &#8220;something&#8221; should be your app name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install
<ul>
<li>Launch the virtual device first by running &#8220;android avd&#8221;, select the device then click &#8220;start&#8221;</li>
<li>Optionally you can choose to wipe user data so that you have a clean start &#8211; I occasionally encounted the problem that App on the device was not properly overwritten and if you hit the same problem, you have to do this</li>
<li>Install to the target device by running &#8220;adb install bin/something-release.apk&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Launch
<ul>
<li>Go to the emulator, do whatever you know to launch the app</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With this approach, my laptop&#8217;s fan is no longer running like a jet plan &#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good to see all connected devices are getting the right time today, and what I need to do is adjust three analog wall clocks.</p>
<p>I read another post, cannot recall details, that somebody had built and been selling Android watch. I think having a Android watch is not that useful unless it is a watch-phone as well, since people still prefer connected on their way, but if some one can build a Android wall clock and use wifi to connect, that wil be great, isn&#8217;t it? Think about it &#8211; I used to put my cell phone, pad, and laptop in another room while I was watching TV (this makes sense, isn&#8217;t it?), and used to forget what I should do which was set up in Google calendar, now if a wal clock can remind me (it&#8217;s just there on the wall), that will be great, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Will search around &#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The AWS App on iOS is pretty much done, at least I have made readonly part of S3 and EC2 works, and I don&#8217;t think write operations (create, update, delete, etc) are feasible to mobile phones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m moving to Windows Phone now, trying to build up similar App in term of functionality &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if I can build things with similar UI since different app store may have totally different tastes/rules on UI standard, better follow what they asked for.</p>
<p>I wish Windows Phone development will be easier thinking of I&#8217;ve done .Net/Visual Studio development before, let&#8217;s see &#8211; I give myself 2 weeks, and will spend no more than an hour per day.</p>
<p>Actually I tried both Android and Windows Phone the other day, trying to get basic idea of development. Obviously I don&#8217;t like Android, either because of I&#8217;m not a Java fan, or because of ugly interface of Eclipse &#8211; it may only be that ugly on OSX though, but I don&#8217;t have space (read: memory) to launch such a fat IDE in my Windows VM so leave it to the last.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know this could be a crazy thing, but why not? Especially I have a Mac in hand so that I can do both at the same time.</p>
<p>Since I know almost nothing about either, and I&#8217;m not good at client side development at all, so I started with a not-that-complicated open source software, WordPress for iOS/Android. It&#8217;s good to see WordPress is almost the same on both platform, this will help me a lot in future work.</p>
<p>The bad thing is, WordPress does not have too many features, such as animation, and so on (sorry all that I know about &#8220;fancy&#8221; is animation &#8230;), so I can only learn basic coding stuffs, but I think it is good enough for now. Anyway it is a API based &#8220;flat&#8221; App, which has a pretty wide market &#8211; think about Amazon AWS manager (I need this), E*Trade App (I&#8217;m using this), and GMail client, etc. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s see what we have now from the Christmas &#8211; a Bambook, a Kindle, a Kindle Fire, a Samsung phone (running Windows Phone), pretty much all popular mobile devices are in my house now (yes, iPhone and iPad came from last year).</p>
<p>I can say all mobile OS&#8217;s are good enough, though iOS is having better operational features, Aneroid is rich of free Apps, and Windows Phone is just &#8230; cute? Sorry I don&#8217;t know what can exactly describe it, but its look and feel is nice.</p>
<p>I think I need to spend some time follow Windows Phone while playing with iOS and Android, will be busy.</p>
