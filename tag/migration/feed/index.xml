										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working on migrate office LAN from one subnet to another subnet, it brings lots of network inter-connection issues, and it seems iptable is Swiss knife that can solve anything :P.</p>
<p>One case is that I need to let machines in new subnet accessing the old subnet, since the dump router is busy enough to handle uplink and VPN and port forwarding, I decided to use a Linux box to get things done, all that I did:<span id="more-1611"></span></p>
<p>1. connect the box to two subnet, actually since two subnet share the same physical network, I just configure a second IP address on the only NIC<br />
2. net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1<br />
3. -A FORWARD -i eth0:1 -j ACCEPT<br />
4. -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</p>
<p>Next thing is that the network printer &#8230; it does not support multiple IP address thus I have to have another host running the IP form the new subnet and then direct everything to the old IP:</p>
<p>1. add the IP from the new subnet to the box, again a second IP for the NIC works<br />
2. net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1<br />
3. -A PREROUTING -d new_IP -j DNAT &#8211;to-destination old_IP<br />
4. -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</p>
<p>after this everything hitting the new_IP will be directed to old_IP.</p>
<p>More examples to come, to show how iptable helps <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it was in year 2005 or 2006 that I migrated everything from CVS to SVN, and it was the time that my company was doing that as well.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think it was in year 2005 or 2006 that I migrated everything from CVS to SVN, and it was the time that my company was doing that as well. Now I&#8217;m migrating to git, and of course, my current company is doing the same thing :P.</p>
<p>Guess everybody knows the reason &#8230; let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s offline support, that you don&#8217;t have to connect to sever to do commit. Further more, subversion does not work well on VirtualBox&#8217;s shared folder, while git has no problem at all, I guess people like me who needs to work on both *ix and Windows platforms have to have this kind of support.</p>
<p>And this is the time to see how many projects I have, WeirdBox is a great thing to keep thinking of I&#8217;ve play with the codes for several years, aws-browser is obviously another thing to keep thinking of it&#8217;s my first app on iOS and AWS (EC2 and S3), XMPP Mail Alert has to be migrated as I&#8217;m using it at this moment (for a friend&#8217;s web site). I cannot recall anything else but will post here if I find any.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m using github, because of feel like safe? At least it&#8217;s not that vulnerable as other small players.</p>
