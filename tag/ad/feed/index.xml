					<description><![CDATA[I could not see ads from Google AdSense in the past several weeks, but weird enough, I still have revenue :P.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I could not see ads from Google AdSense in the past several weeks, but weird enough, I still have revenue :P. I changed to another AdSense plugin but it&#8217;s still the same. I don&#8217;t think Google&#8217;s service is having problem, especially for this long, so it could be either my account is having problem, or Google knows it&#8217;s me so refuse to show me ads, or my IP is blacklisted (both office and home? cannot be &#8230;).</p>
<p>Anyway, will keep watching this for some time but it&#8217;s definitely not urgent and important &#8230; I think all I&#8217;ve got from Google for more than a year is less than $10, sure, it&#8217;s not Google&#8217;s problem, it&#8217;s me not getting the site popular :D.</p>
