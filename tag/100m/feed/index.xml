<p>It sounds like simple, right? Yea, I tried ethtool to force them running on GigE, didn&#8217;t work; I tried to change to another switch port, didn&#8217;t work &#8230; after blocking myself from the servers for several times (ethtool!), I finally decided to change to use 2nd NIC on those two servers. They were good, running at GigE immediately after plugging into the switch.<span id="more-1664"></span></p>
<p>Then today, I was thinking of doing cabling in the server room, since those 1st NIC still have cables on them, I decided to move those cables to the 2nd NICs which means I don&#8217;t have to change notes on switch ports. Well, interesting things happened &#8211; those two port run at 100Mbps again &#8230;</p>
<p>Well, everyone knows where the problem now, right? I swapped out those two cables and everything looks perfect, I think I will switch back to 1st NIC later on but that&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>I hate cables.</p>
