										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think it was in year 2005 or 2006 that I migrated everything from CVS to SVN, and it was the time that my company was doing that as well. Now I&#8217;m migrating to git, and of course, my current company is doing the same thing :P.</p>
<p>Guess everybody knows the reason &#8230; let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s offline support, that you don&#8217;t have to connect to sever to do commit. Further more, subversion does not work well on VirtualBox&#8217;s shared folder, while git has no problem at all, I guess people like me who needs to work on both *ix and Windows platforms have to have this kind of support.</p>
<p>And this is the time to see how many projects I have, WeirdBox is a great thing to keep thinking of I&#8217;ve play with the codes for several years, aws-browser is obviously another thing to keep thinking of it&#8217;s my first app on iOS and AWS (EC2 and S3), XMPP Mail Alert has to be migrated as I&#8217;m using it at this moment (for a friend&#8217;s web site). I cannot recall anything else but will post here if I find any.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m using github, because of feel like safe? At least it&#8217;s not that vulnerable as other small players.</p>
