										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Freaky!</p>
<p>Here what I have done in the past several days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Majority of my time was spent on tokenizer/segmentation stuffs, which is purely C/C++</li>
<li>I used PHP as the glue to try out my segmentation codes so I do various PHP stuffs</li>
<li>I need to collect some data for other people test out the result so obviously I need to deal with Hive, and HQL</li>
<li>I have to create different adhoc shell scripts while dealing with above</li>
<li>Someone asked for a Python extension for the segmentation library so I also spent (little) time on Python codes</li>
<li>I was reading a C# program, trying to translate it to C++, I cannot believe I made it and I have to say, C# is some sort of &#8220;advanced Visual Basic&#8221; &#8230;</li>
<li>Again lots of segmenation algorithms are implemented in Java (thanks Lucene/Nutch/Solr) so occasionally I need to read Java codes and use them as reference to my C++ programs, most time for edge cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually it was fun other than sometime I misput $ in front of a variable in a C++ program, or use ; to end the statement in python, and got confused with C++ containers and Java containers &#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
