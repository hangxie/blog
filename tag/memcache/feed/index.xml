<p>I had alert from a memcached service that mentioning for all the time that hit rate was too low, after checking it I found it was actually because the traffic was too low (the site was not in production yet), so how to solve this problem?</p>
<p>After thinking of various &#8220;serious&#8221; solutions, I finally turned to running a script, keep hitting the entries (actually, only one specific entry) in the cache, so to raise the hit rate to a level that makes Nagios stop alerting me.</p>
<p>OK, OK, I know this is bad, but fun, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Actually this causes another thinking &#8211; if there is a particular key having high miss rate, do we care? If we do then the monitoring mechanism won&#8217;t work for that case &#8230;</p>
