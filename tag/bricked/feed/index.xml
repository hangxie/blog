										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What you need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Macbook Pro + Virtual Box + Windows XP VM<br />
Alright, I&#8217;m kidding â€¦ you just need a Windows machine, I tried Windows 7 and Windows 8 (using Windows 7 drivers) are both working, but in case you just have a Mac like me, VM is the way to go. You&#8217;d better map all USB devices to the Windows VM since it changes name during regular boot+USB debugging, and recovery boot.</li>
<li>Download the recovery kit from <a href="http://www.rikomagic.com/En/download.asp">here</a>, use the MK802III link, you will get a zip file. Unzip, launch RKBatchTool.exe and leave it running on your Windows machine.</li>
<li>Unplug everything from MK802III, open the case of MK802III &#8211; nail is the best tool for me and it should work for you as well</li>
<li>Follow the document (one in English and one in Chinese) to short circuit the two pins, and plug in the USB to your computer at the same time. I actually found there are two small dot beside the other side of the chip which is more easier if you have a flat metal piece instead of a tiny needle.</li>
<li>If everything works smoothly, you will see one block in the RKBatchTool.exe interface changed to some other color (different color may have different meaning, but I really want to ignore it for now).</li>
<li>Click the button with &#8220;â€¦&#8221; on the top right corner of the RKBatchTool.exe interface, pick the img file from the zip archive (should be RKM802III_20121115Recovery.img), click &#8220;Upgrade&#8221; button (that&#8217;s the 2nd button from left, at the bottom of the interface), it will take 2~3 minutes.</li>
<li>Power off/on the MK802III, you will get original official Android back running on the stick.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Playing with this neat tiny computer and was trying to run Ubuntu on it but hit all sort of problem, and, at last, I think I bricked it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Now to take it back, I need a Windows machine (sigh&#8230;) to flush the ROM as I cannot find something similiar to RKAndroidTool.exe for Mac. I suspect it&#8217;s some sort of TFTP clients but just don&#8217;t want to dig in more.</p>
<p>Later on I found a Windows 8 machine running there but again I cannot play with MK802III as driver could not be found, search the Web &#8230; it was said <a href="http://vondroid.com/threads/rk3066-drivers-for-windows-8.830/">Windows 7 driver should work</a>, but you have to <a href="http://laslow.net/2012/03/14/disable-driver-signature-enforcement-in-windows-8/">disable Windows 8&#8217;s driver signature enforcement</a>. During the search I also found something pretty useful, to <a href="http://www.lostintechnology.com/windows/how-to-find-drivers-for-unknown-devices-in-windows/">dig out unknown devices on Windows</a>.</p>
<p>Will play with MK802III again tonight.</p>
