										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m having troubles in managing projects currently in my hands, I think I need to delegate some tasks so that I can focus on the most important thing, but who can do that?</p>
<p>Supposedly there will be 3~4 people get on board in the coming month, and there should be one takes over product line, and the other can take over IT mail, and I will find another one (wish soon) covering consumer mail’s technical side, then I can step back to oversee everything.</p>
<p>What I am doing now:</p>
<ul>
<li>The consumer mail, both production and technical and project management sides </li>
<li>The IT (company’s) mail, technical side </li>
<li>The universal message system, as a project manager </li>
</ul>
<p>and in each project there are several routes need to be taken care of …</p>
<p>I’m lazy in hiring recently, I need to cheer myself up and back to energic.</p>
<p>BTW, who’s still reading this blog, would you please post something so that I know I’m not talking to air?</p>
