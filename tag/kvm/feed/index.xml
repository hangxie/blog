										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time to play with Virutalization again, this time I&#8217;m using kvm on CentOS 6, which has pretty many documentation but do need to pay more attention on details &#8211; I was locked out of the box last night after changing the network setting (with mistakes for sure <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ), this should be avoided for anyone who&#8217;s going to do this. Again, stay beside your machine whenever you are to do the initial setup.</p>
<p>After network setup is done, everything else is pretty smoothy, just need to read lots of man pages to know syntax of those qemu and virt-* commands. I repeated several times by virt-install, then virsh destroy and virsh undefine, etc., then virt-install again. There should be some better way to change configuration for existing VMs but for me, it&#8217;s much more easier to run from scratch.</p>
<p>Now I have 4 VMs running on a 8-cores/32G box, it seems everything&#8217;s OK so far, but I need to do some more tests &#8211; especially performance test &#8211; before carrying on.</p>
<p>BTW, a VNC viewer plus ssh tunnel is a must to do the setup, since I still haven&#8217;t figure out how to auto-installation, i.e. touchless, or installation without manually involve the process.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Just found that I didn&#8217;t do any research to compare Xen and kvm, obviously two are both announcing they perform much better than VMWare, which I believe that&#8217;s true, but I haven&#8217;t read anything about xen vs. kvm yet.
