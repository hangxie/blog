										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here comes 3rd wave &#8230;</p>
<p>1. compare strings<br />
   It seems NSString did not overload the compare operator (==), or maybe Object-C does not have this kind of idea, so don&#8217;t use == to compare strings, instead, you need to use compare: or caseInsensitiveCompare: and their dialects.</p>
<p>2. catching cell selection event in a table view<br />
   I was trying to subclass <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableViewCell_Class/Reference/Reference.html">UITableViewCell</a> to make it works, but actually don&#8217;t have to be this complicated &#8211; all that I need to do is deal with &#8220;- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath&#8221; in the table view, and this saves me a lot of effort as I don&#8217;t have to go through all the difficulties to get storyboard, etc with codes within a Cell class.</p>
<p>3. singleton, property or method?<br />
   I created a singleton class, then found in Object-C, it&#8217;s better to static method (if you can) instead of property. It takes quite a lot keystrokes to use a property, while using method is not that hard.</p>
<p>4. passing data to a view controller in a storyboard based application<br />
   &#8211; define a property of the child view controller for holding data<br />
   &#8211; in parent view controller&#8217;s prepareForSegue, set the property of the child controller<br />
   &#8211; that&#8217;s it &#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This may not be useful to others, but it bothered me quite some time, so I&#8217;d like to write it down in case some others stuck at the same place as I did.</p>
<p>getMetadataForKey calls from aws-ios-sdk, actually it:</p>
<ol>
<li>returns user defined meta data, nothing to do with s3&#8217;s meta data</li>
<li>the key used here will be prepended a &#8220;x-aws-meta-&#8220;, that is, in aws console, we will see a meta data entry keyed with &#8220;x-aws-meta-hahaha&#8221;, but in ios app you need to use &#8220;hahaha&#8221; to get the value</li>
</ol>
<p>some other interesting stuffs &#8230; don&#8217;t use S3GetObjectRequest/Response call to get object&#8217;s header information, as it will indeed download the object. Instead, you should use S3GetObjectMetadataRequest/Response.</p>
<p>To get &#8220;Expiry Date&#8221; and  &#8220;Lifecycle Rule&#8221; information as they are shown on aws console, you need to use response&#8221;s valueForHTTPHeaderField method with key &#8220;x-amz-expiration&#8221;, the parse it &#8230; I guess there should be something more easier but havenn&#8217;t figured out how. Both &#8220;expiry-date&#8221; and &#8220;rule-id&#8221; are there so you can use them, note that they can be empty so better prepare for that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here comes the second part of ios development tips which follows <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2012/01/27/ios-development-tips/">first part</a>, I&#8217;m starting over the number now so to ease my life.</p>
<p>1. How to navigate to a view in another view<br />
   &#8211; original post is here:<br />
     * <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8221787/perform-segue-on-viewdidload">dealing with views in a storyboard based application</a><br />
     * some other helpful discussions are here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8348109/how-can-i-manually-switch-between-uiviewcontrollers-in-storyboard">manually switch view controllers in storyboard</a>, and <a href="http://how-can-i-manually-switch-between-uiv.8348109.ccqq.net/">another similar topic</a><br />
   &#8211; idea<br />
     * actually the basic idea is pretty simple and straightforward &#8211; you create a new view (the one you want to display), and push it to the top of the navigationcontroller (which actually is a stack), that&#8217;s it &#8230;<br />
     * tricky part #1: this cannot be done in a viewDidLoad event as view was not fully loaded at that time so you can nothing, the place I found that is workable is viewDidAppear event<br />
     * tricky part #2: ViewController&#8217;s initWithNibName does not work &#8230; I haven&#8217;t figure out the exact reason yet but you have to use instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier comes from storyboard<br />
     * tricky part #3: nibname &#8230; gave me QUITE A LOT headache, it should be &#8220;UIViewController-<View Controller's Object ID>&#8220;, you can get the object ID from Interface Builder, in the identity inspector tab</p>
