										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Obviously <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mmseg4j/">mmseg4j</a> if great for Java, while <a href="http://www.coreseek.cn/opensource/mmseg/">libmmseg</a> seems promising for C++, and for PHP &#8230; sigh.</p>
<p>I waste lot of time on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xsplit/">xsplit</a>, and found that it was doing great marketing as it shows up in almost all search result pages, but to me it just doesn&#8217;t work, and some others complained the same thing.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/anjuke/php-mmseg/blob/master/mmseg.cpp">php-mmseg</a> is working well, though it was no long active. Actually I believe well-written codes would need less maintenance (think about qmail), so as long as it works I don&#8217;t care too much.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m trying to move from Java to PHP to do the term extraction job, nutch and solr are great, but just too heavy to fit into my world.</p>
