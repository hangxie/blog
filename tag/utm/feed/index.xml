										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu 22.04 was <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-22-04-lts-released">just released</a>, I managed to upgrade my WordPress site (running on VM and only <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2022/03/04/move-to-static-site/">publish static site</a>), it was not as smooth as I thought, there were quite some small problems here and there, but eventually it worked after like 4 hours of troubleshooting, and so on.</p>
<p>As a side note, I no longer running Parallels since I found it tricked me to subscription which involves $79.99 per year, luckily I noticed the weird charge on my credit card so was able to cancel it the same day. I&#8217;m running my VM on <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> now, I didn&#8217;t notice performance difference between UTM and Parallels, though Parallels does provide more convenient features like desktop integration, snapshot, etc.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve been running Ubuntu since 10.04, but I&#8217;m seriously thinking of moving away from it now due to snap, there are more and more applications over Ubuntu dropped deb support and are solely on snap only, I don&#8217;t mind a distro changes its package management tool like yum to dnf, but I just don&#8217;t want to have 2 package management mechanism at the same time.</p>
<p>I may not run Fedora as I need LTS, I cannot choose Rocky as it (actually RHEL) lacks of aarch64 support. Most likely I&#8217;m going to play with Debian or Arch.</p>
