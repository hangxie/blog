										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m thinking of getting my home development environment another plan &#8211; instead of running couple of VMs on a single big box, maybe I can use couple of small computers to get things done.</p>
<p>This could be possible after checked online, though price may be higher. I&#8217;m still looking for single board computer/client computer that are as small as a CD box (or a little bit bigger), does not have to come with a disk as I can run NFS for it, and it does not have to be x86 based as I can run Linux on almost all sort of CPUs.</p>
<p>Will see.</p>
