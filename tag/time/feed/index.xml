										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just found that I had no time to use those fancy mobile apps, either popular SNS Apps like twitter, facebook, or those &#8220;utilities&#8221; like yelp or tango. The app I used the most is Google Navigation which serves as my GPS device, and GMail/Mail Apps as I&#8217;m still a mail guy. Some other Apps consumed a little time, such as Price Check from Amazon, GPS Tracker, and Youni SMS.</p>
<p>The problem is that I don&#8217;t have much so-called fragmented time &#8211; I wake up in the morning, drive to office, sit in front of my laptop for almost the whole day, then drive home, then sit in front of my laptop for another couple of hours, then go to bed. I cannot twittering or update my facebook status while I was driving, and in the other time I don&#8217;t want to use mobile phone cos even the Pad is far more easier to use.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how many people are in my situation &#8211; does it mean all mobile Apps are for those who take public transportation, or those who work/study for not a full day?</p>
