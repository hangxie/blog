										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several teams that want to provide technical solution for my team in various area, and I&#8217;m thinking of adopting them or rejecting.</p>
<p>There is no sure rule for that, basically I need to make sure: first they perform good enough to support my products, second, they need to be quite reliable which means I will not worry about losing support, and third, they should focus on technical solution instead of trying to take product away from me.</p>
<p>So far the only decision had been made is that I&#8217;m going to use cloud storage team&#8217;s solution (network disk), I will put attachment for outgoing mails there to support unlimited attachment, later on will put attachments for incoming mails there. Search team also wants me leverage their platform, but I have to say their solution is not good enough for me and quite ad-hoc, so someone from my team will use Lucene to build our first solution, then we can compare to see if we are going to migrate or not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to keep my team focus on mail/message area, thus meta data won&#8217;t be taken by anyone else. Also, anti-spam is key platform for my team so I won&#8217;t give up. For search and massive data storage in key-value pair format, I may give them out.</p>
<p>Tough decision though, always need to convince my team members agree that we should focus on key features instead of doing everything all by ourselves. We are still a big company and share a common platform will give the whole company a good shape of look.</p>
