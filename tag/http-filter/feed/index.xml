										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, one and half month passed and I never post even a single word &#8230; yes I was busy but main reason is &#8230; I was lazy.</p>
<p>Alright, some updates &#8211; I successfully migrate the bcookie module from Apache HTTPd to nginx, things were really tough at the very beginning whenever all you understand is Apache. However, at this stage I would like to say nginx is kind of neat and elegant, expanding it is not that hard though you have to build everythingÂ  in one shot (i.e. no dso allowed), I&#8217;d like to dig in why they have design like this as this is really uncommon in modern era.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m moving to .Net now, again I have no idea so far, but I believe I need to write a filter in C# (YAY!), but before that I need get IIS up and running, and determine if there is any compatibility issues between different version of IIS (and .Net Framework).</p>
<p>Stay tuned, I will post whenever I make any progress and most likely that will be the time I move to Java container part &#8211; Jetty or Tomcat, not sure so far.</p>
