										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to test two types of authentication system, one is what seems to be common in current days which utilizes database and cache, the popular combination is mysql+memcached, and the other is what I recommended to others for authentication system for all the time &#8211; LDAP, and surely openldap is the first choice (Fedora DS is not available on other platforms, though seems it&#8217;s easier to manage).</p>
<p>I compose couple of items describing the tests I&#8217;m going to take, and I will review this couple of times while I&#8217;m doing the setup.</p>
<p>First, application. I had some assumption based on my past experience, that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good user</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<blockquote>
<li>1 authentication (login with right username and password)</li>
<li>10 look up, getting user&#8217;s attributes (for showing them on some pages, note that reading these attributes needs to go through couple of tables)</li>
<li>1 edit, such as changing profile</li>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bad user</li>
<blockquote>
<li>1 authentication (login with incorrect username or password)</li>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>and the ratio of good vs. bad user is 1:5 (yea, lots of abuse &#8230;).</p>
<p>There will be 1M registered users, but the &#8220;good user&#8221; will only include 100K of them, which reflects 10% active users rate, actually this is already high. There will be 3 PHP pages: login.php to do authentication, pref.php retrieve preferences of the user, and edit.php try to change user&#8217;s profile. All these take GET query strings so to make test easier.</p>
<p>Environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>database testing environment</li>
<blockquote>
<li>debian acts as web server, running apache and PHP</li>
<li>freebsd acts as client, generating load with apache&#8217;s ab</li>
<li>centos is mysql&#8217;s master, handling both read and write</li>
<li>opensuse is mysql&#8217;s slave, handling read only, note that we are not using mysql-proxy as it seems to me it is far away from production quality so far</li>
<li>ubuntu and fedora run memcached, in TCP mode with 64M cache memory each</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to post database schema later on</li>
</blockquote>
<li>ldap testing environment</li>
<blockquote>
<li>debian acts as web server, running apache and PHP</li>
<li>freebsd acts as client, generating load with apache&#8217;s ab</li>
<li>ubuntu and fedora are running openldap in mirror mode</li>
<li>again, schema will be posted here later on</li>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>maybe the only unreal part above is openldap will run in mirror mode, which is not extensible &#8211; I will check to see what kind of openldap replication is suitable for production deployment.</p>
<p>Pretty much that&#8217;s it, will update once I review this plan.</p>
