										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I, personally, still don&#8217;t think saltstack is a configuration management tool, it&#8217;s more like a remote execution engine that allow you launch command to multiple hosts at the same time. saltstack does not do well in maintaining configuration up-to-date, or maybe it does, but we are using it in a wrong way.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve done most of my part with monitoring, after migrating to AWS I think the next thing is to review configuration management, I would still prefer CFEngine, though keep saltstack as a remote execution engine, as anyway we (read: ops) need this.</p>
<p>So the next question is, how to migrate saltstack&#8217;s state to CFEngine&#8217;s promise?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working for the big chip company now, sound a little bit weird, though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m sitting in backend team focusing on DevOps, I guess I will be in this mixed role till we find a dedicated DevOps guy. I guess whenever that happens, I&#8217;ve already finished monitoring facility (plus logistical stuffs like on-call schedule, etc.), and should have finished the plan to migrate from Rackspace to AWS.</p>
<p>Everything works smoothly so far except git &#8211; I admit current company is using git in a modern way, but I don&#8217;t think previous company was doing something wrong. Anyway, I believe people do have different ideas of how to use git, I just have to fit into the company&#8217;s style.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite like saltstack although I&#8217;m still trying to get familiar with it. However, before I raise this as a concern to the team, I&#8217;d like to make sure everything that saltstack is doing can be done by cfengine.</p>
<p>Ah yea, also need to evaluate <a href="http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/">Shinken</a> as it&#8217;s a pure Python solution, and &#8220;we are a python house&#8221;.</p>
