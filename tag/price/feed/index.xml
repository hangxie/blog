										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve moved to Amazon EC2 as mentioned <a href="https://xiehang.com/blog/2012/01/04/evaluating-ec2/">here</a> and mentioned the monthly pay is $17, that was based on EC2 node&#8217;s cost is $14 I think, and after dig into EC2&#8217;s offers, I found something more useful, see below:</p>
<p>Amazon has this <a href="">Reserved Instance</a> which is pretty good to Web servers that needs to be running for all the time, I did some calculation and here is the comparison for 1-year term:</p>
<table align="center" border="1">
<tr>
<th>Plan</th>
<th>One time</th>
<th>Hourly</th>
<th>Yearly</th>
<th>Monthly (alloc.)</p>
<tr>
<td>On demand</td>
<td align="right">0</td>
<td align="right">0.020</td>
<td align="right">175.20</td>
<td align="right">14.60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>light</td>
<td align="right">23</td>
<td align="right">0.012</td>
<td align="right">128.12</td>
<td align="right">10.68</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>medium</td>
<td align="right">54</td>
<td align="right">0.007</td>
<td align="right">115.32</td>
<td align="right">9.61</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>heavy</td>
<td align="right">62</td>
<td align="right">0.005</td>
<td align="right">105.80</td>
<td align="right">8.82</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Although 3-years term may save more, I don&#8217;t want to sign such a long contract as $8.82 per month is good enough to me now.</p>
<p>I will move to the heavy one after my free tier expires.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mom&#8217;s computer is too old to be &#8220;cured&#8221; &#8211; I didn&#8217;t check through but I believe it is running a Pentium 4 at frequency 1.x Ghz, and it has 192M or 256M memory. Mom told me couple of times that if I want to do anything with the machine, I have to be patient.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m less patient :(. So I decided to get a new desktop for her. I went to an &#8220;electronic market&#8221; with RMB 5000 in my pocket, thinking of getting a desktop plus a printer.</p>
<p>Well, none of those branded reseller could sell me a machine without display/keyboard/mouse, so I went to a DIY shop, asking them build up a basic desktop for me. After discussing about the configuration (some AMD Sempron dual-core, 2G mem, 250G disk, a DVD-RW, all others are on the integrated motherboard), the guy told me it is RMB 1,600, about $230. People told me you have to bargain for the price there, but I didn&#8217;t that day :). The price was far below my expectation so I don&#8217;t mind they are going to get 100 or 200 more in profit.</p>
<p>Actually I was wondering how they can make money to support all the employees there &#8211; there is a seems-to-be-the-boss, with 2 boys sound like senior (they can make a configuration and can do the installation), plus 3 others seems to be intern or something (they were helping). It was said the cost of rental is couple of thousands a month, and I don&#8217;t think they are going to make more than 10 deals a day &#8211; and it was a weekend.</p>
<p>Whenever I went to printer it is another story &#8211; inkjet are roughly $70, while the ink will be $30, laser printer is about $300, while the toner is about $150. The business model is pretty clear here, that is, you get the printer for almost free (actually inkjet printer is free as it contains two ink boxes inside, right?) and get profit from ink/toner. I&#8217;m not sure if HP is the one invited this but obviously it&#8217;s a good deal.</p>
<p>BTW, I didn&#8217;t buy the printer as I don&#8217;t think my parents want to afford the cost.:)</p>
