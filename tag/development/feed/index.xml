<p>I wish it can have a client like Google Drive or SkyDrive, that simply sync up a folder on the laptop, and I also wish it can have a iPad App (or HD, whatever) so that I don&#8217;t have to run iPhone app on my iPad, I wish it does not set my uploads to public bu default, but &#8230;</p>
<p>after all, it is still a great product thinking of 50G free storage, and it&#8217;s a developer friendly service that even I can understand their protocol <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve applied for a dev account and will try to build up either desktop app or ipad app for my own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eclipse just ate too much CPU and memory resource (thanks Java), so I decided to move to <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html">command line android development</a>.</p>
<p>And again, I will keep a copy of steps here so that ease my future lookup:<span id="more-1458"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Preparation
<ul>
<li>Install android SDK, let&#8217;s assume you download and unzipped everything to /some/where/to/sdk, and added tools/ and platform-tools/ to PATH already</li>
<li>Downloaded necessary SDK by running &#8220;android sdk&#8221;</li>
<li>Created necessary virtual devices by running &#8220;android avd&#8221;</li>
<li>Generate your private key by running &#8220;keytool -J-Dfile.encoding=utf8 -genkey -v -keystore android.keystore -alias release -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000&#8221; under the sdk/ directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build
<ul>
<li>My project was generated by cordova, so I don&#8217;t have to create the project from scratch, but your situation may be different so play with it (android create project) by your own &#8230;</li>
<li>edit the ant.properties under project root directory, adding two lines like these<br />
key.store=/some/where/to/sdk/android.keystore<br />
key.alias=release</li>
<li>Above command will generate multiple *-release*.apk under bin/ directory, and the *-release.apk is what we are going to use for installation, assume it is something-release.apk, which &#8220;something&#8221; should be your app name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install
<ul>
<li>Launch the virtual device first by running &#8220;android avd&#8221;, select the device then click &#8220;start&#8221;</li>
<li>Optionally you can choose to wipe user data so that you have a clean start &#8211; I occasionally encounted the problem that App on the device was not properly overwritten and if you hit the same problem, you have to do this</li>
<li>Install to the target device by running &#8220;adb install bin/something-release.apk&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Launch
<ul>
<li>Go to the emulator, do whatever you know to launch the app</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With this approach, my laptop&#8217;s fan is no longer running like a jet plan &#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are in the design phrase of a new product, since there are lots of features and it seems they can group up to twitter-like, blog-like, forum-like, mail-like, and so on, so we started looking around for existing open source products to fit in.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this while driving home last night, and a interesting idea jumped into my mind &#8211; maybe I can use my knowledge on mail system to contribute some stuffs.</p>
<p>Then this came to my mind &#8211; whenever all you have is a hammer, then everything else in the world would be a nail. I know this is not a praise, but I don&#8217;t care, I just want to do everything through an existing mail feature, or a little bit tweaked mail feature.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to write a series to see if I can make everything popular in this world (SNS, Mobile, etc) built up mostly on a mail system, &#8220;mostly&#8221; means at least 80% of the features. I&#8217;m not going to try to replace systems/infrastructures that support mail running, like storage, authentication, etc, since that will make things ridicolous (chicken and egg problem). I&#8217;m going to assume that there is a running mail system already, and I&#8217;m going to try my best to build everything else based on mail.</p>
<p>This is totally for fun, don&#8217;t follow this approach for your production system. ;-</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been spending time on various projects in the past several weeks and &#8220;context switch&#8221; took me way too much time than I was expecting.</p>
<p>So I decided to get things a little bit more sorted, say, consolidate technical platforms to some level so that I can share knowledge among all projects so to reduce the time spending on thinking and searching for solutions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to stick on C/C++ for components development and PHP for web site, and use HBase as my backend storage solution. I still need to spend time on mobile platforms (yes, there is a &#8220;s&#8221; there since I need to cover Windows Phone, Android, and iOS), plus desktop include MacOS and Windows. So overall I will be working on C++/PHP over Linux, Object C on MacOS/iOS, and C# on Windows Phone/Windows. The last unsettled issue is I still have some applications written in Visual C++ (pure native code) and I&#8217;m not sure if I should migrate them, but so far just leave it there as I don&#8217;t have time dealing with Windows desktop yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Obviously <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mmseg4j/">mmseg4j</a> if great for Java, while <a href="http://www.coreseek.cn/opensource/mmseg/">libmmseg</a> seems promising for C++, and for PHP &#8230; sigh.</p>
<p>I waste lot of time on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xsplit/">xsplit</a>, and found that it was doing great marketing as it shows up in almost all search result pages, but to me it just doesn&#8217;t work, and some others complained the same thing.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/anjuke/php-mmseg/blob/master/mmseg.cpp">php-mmseg</a> is working well, though it was no long active. Actually I believe well-written codes would need less maintenance (think about qmail), so as long as it works I don&#8217;t care too much.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m trying to move from Java to PHP to do the term extraction job, nutch and solr are great, but just too heavy to fit into my world.</p>
