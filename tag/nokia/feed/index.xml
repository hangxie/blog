										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an old model, but I&#8217;ve been expecting for it for quite some time.</p>
<p>Now I have one in my hand, it is pretty much what I want for all these years <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; QWERTY keyboard, wireless and cellular connection, display is big enough, and, phone is big enough :D. Pity it does not support 3G on AT&amp;T, but I guess EDGE will be good enough since I was on it with my blackberry.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t found enough software for it, but at least I have putty now so anything else could be delayed (yes, I&#8217;m still looking). Now I want a good connection manager (say, switch between wifi and cellular network automatically), some games (boring games to kill time), and I need a good Jabber client (or a multiple protocol client). Sure I wish all these can be free, but I will pay some if they are good.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s weird to me that Microsoft has their messenger client on Symbian, while Yahoo and Google don&#8217;t have one. If I understand correctly, Symbian is one of the major competitor of Windows Mobile, so what&#8217;s the logic behind all these?</p>
